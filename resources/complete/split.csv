This is according to an internal survey conducted by the National Association of Shop Stewards (LVV) on behalf of the newspaper AD. More than half of the respondents said they had noticed an increase of transgressive behavior.Two-thirds of the complaints were filed by employees. In slightly less than half of the cases, a supervisor was the one who displayed the undesirable behavior; in a quarter of the cases, it was a colleague. Furthermore, most of the cases involved harassment (over 56 percent), followed by sexual harassment (11 percent).Of the 173 LVV members who responded to the survey, 89 percent said awareness of cross-border behavior in the workplace has increased in the past year. For instance, people were more likely to be addressed about transgressive behavior, most confidants said. In addition, some respondents said there is less kissing and cuddling, such as at birthdays or Christmas and New Year's celebrations. People also no longer dare to make ""inappropriate jokes.""Alleged abuses behind the scenes of the tv program The Voice of Holland were exposed last January by the program BOOS. Shortly after the publication of the sexual transgressive behavior at the RTL 4 program, 19 women spoke about misconduct by band leader Jeroen Rietbergen, 15 about a director, and two women filed charges against coach Ali B. However, after a year, the victims are disappointed after the Voice scandal, as they still have to wait for results of the investigaton of the law firm Van Doorne and of the Public Prosecution Office (OM). “Waiting for clarity is exhausting,” said Sébas Diekstra to AD, the lawyer who assists victims. “It is painful and frustrating that there is now only one case left that is directly related to The Voice.”This concerns former The Voice contestant Nienke Wijnhoven, who filed sexual misconduct charges twice. The charges were against band leader Jeroen Rietbergen and director Martijn N. However, the charges against the director were dropped in November, causing frustration among the victims.Reporting by ANP and NL Times",7 January 2023 - 17:00,Crime

With these executions, the regime has now handed down a total of four death sentences, according to the Reuters news agency. Three other people were also sentenced to death in the case, and 11 others were sent to prison. Organizers of the protests are calling on the Netherlands and the European Union to take tougher action against the regime in Iran. ""They are becoming more and more brazen,"" the organizers said. They expect about 100 to 120 participants at the demonstration.Mass demonstrations for more freedom and against the Tehran regime have been taking place in Iran since mid-September. The wave of protests is the largest in Iran in years and started after the death of 22-year-old Mahsa Amini. She died in custody after being arrested by the morality police for allegedly wearing her headscarf too loosely.Meanwhile, thousands of people have been arrested in the protests in Iran. Several have already been sentenced to death. According to the organization Iran Human Rights Watch, hundreds of protesters have been killed by Iranian security forces.",7 January 2023 - 16:00,Politics

""All passengers have now been rebooked. They will fly back on Sunday at the latest,"" a KLM spokesperson said, according to De Telegraaf.
On Wednesday, a KLM plane in Singapore was unable to depart for the Netherlands. Due to a technical defect, the flight was postponed by one day. 400 passengers then had to spend the night in the Asian city-state.Some of the passengers were vacationers returning from Bali, as the plane was coming from there. The plane was supposed to make only a short stopover in Singapore. According to KLM, the passengers were accommodated in hotels later on.However, the repair of the plane took longer than originally planned, so everyone was stuck in Singapore a little longer. ""The safety of passengers and crew was not at risk,"" the KLM spokesperson stressed.The plane in question, however, is still in Singapore. It is currently unclear when the plane will be repaired and able to depart for Amsterdam again.The KLM spokesperson also responded on Saturday to the new Dutch rules for travelers coming to the Netherlands from China. They will need a negative coronavirus test starting next Tuesday. ""We will of course comply with the applicable laws and regulations of the Netherlands and the countries we fly to,"" the spokesperson explained.At the moment, China is battling a major Corona outbreak. Other European countries have also already taken action in response. However, KLM is not required by the government to check for test certificates itself when boarding in China, but the airline must inform passengers that a test is mandatory and what the consequences may be if the test is not negative. The actual check takes place at Schiphol Airport.",7 January 2023 - 15:10,Business

The Netherlands and the United Kingdom are joint initiators of the meeting, which aims to provide practical and financial support to the International Criminal Court (ICC) in investigating and prosecuting war crimes in Ukraine.The organizers of the event are British Deputy Prime Minister Dominic Raab and Dutch Minister of Justice and Security Dilan Yeşilgöz. ""The reports and images of Russia's illegal and unprovoked armed attack on Ukraine are horrific,"" Yeşilgöz said in a statement. ""For us, it is clear: these crimes must not go unpunished.""Raab added that ""Russian forces must know that they cannot act with impunity, and we will support Ukraine until justice is served.”In addition, Chief Prosecutor of the Criminal Court Karim Khan will brief ministers on the ICC's work. At the moment, prosecutors continue to gather evidence of atrocities and sexual violence in recaptured areas of Ukraine.The meeting at Lancaster House comes at a time when Russia is stepping up its campaign of terror against Ukraine, attacking key energy infrastructure and plunging people into the darkness and cold of winter, the British government statement said. ""Nearly a year on from the illegal invasion, the international community must do all it can to support the International Criminal Court to hold war criminals accountable for the atrocities we are witnessing."" The ministers will also discuss how to help victims and witnesses give their testimonies without causing them further suffering.Last year, the Netherlands sent two forensic teams under the banner of the ICC to Ukraine to collect evidence. Two new missions are planned for this year. The Netherlands also supports the ICC, based in The Hague, with financial assistance and personnel.",7 January 2023 - 14:22,Politics

And this was despite the fact that in most places people were allowed to set off fireworks themselves for the first time in years. That's the first impression from an ANP tour of about 160 of the 342 municipalities in the Netherlands.So far, about 90 municipalities have assessed the damage. In total, almost 1 million euros worth of damage was caused there last New Year's Eve. In the same municipalities last year, the bill was almost 1.5 million euros. In about 20 municipalities however, there was more damage than in the previous year, and costs decreased in more than 50 municipalities.About 60 municipalities are still in the process of assessing the damage and therefore cannot yet provide information on the amount of damage. Among them are cities such as Rotterdam (350,000 euros in damage last year) and The Hague (465,000 euros last year). Damage is also still being assessed in cities such as Utrecht, Eindhoven, Breda, Nijmegen, Apeldoorn, Haarlem, Enschede, Zwolle, Zoetermeer, Leiden and Delft.Overall, Amsterdam has the highest costs at the moment. In the Dutch capital, damage amounted to 217,400 euros. According to the municipality, 66 garbage cans, 43 container pits, 23 underground and 12 above-ground containers, 15 parking meters, 25 bus shelters, 41 traffic signs, two street signs and a bench were damaged. However, this is less than last year, when the damage amounted to more than 260,000 euros.In Hellendoorn in the province of Overijssel, the damage almost doubled from 14,500 euros to 28,500 euros.""Especially the replacement of complete playground equipment is a big expense,"" the municipality informed. In the neighboring municipality of Rijssen-Holten, the bill also rose from nearly 12,500 euros to more than 27,000 euros. In addition, Zutphen now has a damage of almost 30,000 euros, compared to over 20,000 euros last year.Pijnacker-Nootdorp, however, saw the biggest drop in spending. The municipality of Zuid-Holland had one of the highest bills in the country last year, after the major cities. The damage at that time amounted to 64,475 euros. But the price now dropped to 19,500 euros. The fact that the damage was so high last year was due to vandals destroying a sports park. Fences, dugouts, an artificial turf pitch and playground equipment were vandalized and had to be replaced.Also Nunspeet (from 45,000 to 4,000 euros), Oss (from 60,260 to 25,703 euros) and Dordrecht (from 51,600 to 19,600 euros) now have significantly less damage to repair. In Staphorst, damage on New Year's Eve amounted to just 500 euros. ""Apart from a single traffic sign, nothing was destroyed,"" according to the city council. A year earlier, Staphorst saw damage of 20,000 euros throughout December. According to the municipality, this month was troubled ""because of the coronavirus and the ban on fireworks"".Roosendaal, however, did not assess the damage.

The alleged attempt to form a cartel stems from documents the province itself posted online under the Open Government Act (WOO), as well as from conversations the broadcasting company NOS had with several legal experts on the subject.The province wanted to coordinate with Schiphol on which farms of farmers would be best suited for buyout so that more freed-up nitrogen space would be available.

However, a provincial official wrote the NOS in an email that “farmers may be negotiating with multiple nitrogen buyers, driving up the price. These are market forces, and you can't always do anything about them, but it may make sense to coordinate on this.""
According to legal experts the broadcast company interviewed, however, the province is not allowed to interfere in the operational affairs of farmers. This is because farmers who want to (re-)sell their farms in the future would no longer have a fair market to do so. Pieter Kuypers, a professor at Radboud University, also told NOS that this supposed coordination regarding nitrogen rights makes the province a business, and therefore subject to competition law. But ""coordination between parties is prohibited under competition law,"" Kuypers said. The reason for Schiphol Airport's strong interest in the nitrogen space is due to the delayed opening of Lelystad Airport. At the moment, no air traffic can take place there, because the airport has problems with the nitrogen permit.

The lowest pay grades will see the biggest increase. PostNL staff will also receive a one-time payment of 1.5 percent of their gross pay next month.In addition, the travel allowance for commuting will be raised in two steps to 22 cents per kilometer, and the pension contribution paid by employees will not be increased until March 2024. Agreements have also been reached on early retirement and reduced working hours for older employees, and there will be special leave for people undergoing gender reassignment.As recently as December, BVPP and CNV had taken action. This led to a new invitation from PostNL to negotiate, BVPP said. Members of the two trade unions have not yet commented on the agreement reached. However, PostNL expects them to vote for or against this agreement in two weeks at the latest.The FNV was outraged because it was not invited to the collective bargaining.

The police there placed a ""stop stick"" on the road, puncturing the tires. All four tires of the car were damaged as a result and the occupants were unable to continue driving and surrendered. Furthermore, explosives were found in the car.Many explosive attacks have been committed in Germany in recent years, often perpetrated by so-called plofkrakers, which are organized gangs from major Dutch cities, trying to open ATMs through explosive attacks. After the explosion, they usually flee in fast vehicles. To avoid falling into the hands of the police, the plofkrakers sometimes take many risks. As a result, several people have already died.",7 January 2023 - 09:57,Crime

The Nazi soldiers had reportedly buried jewelry, precious stones, gold watches and coins in ammunition boxes after finding them in Arnhem. Back then, the valuables had been blown out of the safe in an Arnhem bank during the violent war.The reason for this was that this week the National Archives unveiled a real treasure map showing the location marked with a cross, which immediately received a great deal of media attention. According to the website of the municipality of Buren, of which Ommeren is a part, it received ""many inquiries about this treasure map and the Nazi treasure"" and now feels compelled to warn treasure hunters of dangers and prohibitions.""Experts point out that the area is near the front line of World War II. Searching there is dangerous because of possible unexploded bombs, land mines or shells. Therefore, we do not advise searching for the Nazi treasure,"" the municipality of Buren stressed. In addition, It is also ""prohibited to use or have with you a metal detector or any other object for detecting metal objects in public without an exemption from the mayor and aldermen"", the municipality continued.However, it is unlikely that anything will be found. After the war, several frantic but unsuccessful searches were made for the treasures, also with detectors in the wider area. The original source of the story, a furniture maker from Baden-Baden who was active in Velp as a parachutist for the German army, was still involved in 1947 to give the Dutch authorities instructions. But the efforts were in vain. The question is now, whether his story was a fabrication or whether others dug up the treasures.",7 January 2023 - 08:15,Politics

This was reported by several mosque umbrella associations, including the Stichting Platform Islamitische Organisaties Rijnmond (SPIOR). The mosque umbrella organizations considered the reflection on undercover investigations a thing of the past for now.In late 2021, the newspaper NRC wrote, based on its own research, that several municipalities had secretly commissioned investigations of the Muslim community. This included collecting sensitive information, such as on mosque administrators and imams. The National Coordinator for Counterterrorism and Security (NCTV) reportedly paid for it and allegedly chose the agency in charge of the investigation.The mosque umbrella association SPIOR stated that over the past 14 months there have been discussions between the government and various Islamic organizations about ""these excessive spying activities and the major breach of trust that has taken place."" During these talks, it was reported that the Islamic organizations are now demanding full access to the documents and a guarantee that nothing like this will ever happen again. Furthermore, they also demanded an apology. ""Once these (demands) are met, there will be room again to start the conversation and work toward a new, constructive relationship between the government and the community.""The mosque umbrella organizations also mentioned that they already came up with a work plan earlier. They found it ""strange"" that they have now been invited again for a reflection meeting and called for ""concrete measures to restore the breach of trust that has occurred."" Therefore, they are more interested in a meeting in a few months, they wrote, at which they can look back on ""first steps"" that must then have been taken by the government in response to the work plan.However, the Ministry of Social Affairs and Employment had not yet responded to the cancellation of the meeting on Thursday evening.",7 January 2023 - 07:45,Politics

Health Minister Ernst Kuipers decided to order the restriction after other European member states had already taken similar measures. China is in the midst of a major coronavirus outbreak after it recently lifted most of its Covid-19 restrictions.The Netherlands has also issued urgent advice to wear a medical face mask on board flights to and from China. More testing of the sewage water at Schiphol Airport will also be conducted to monitor the situation.Kuipers had asked the Eerste Kamer, the upper house of Parliament, to come back from recess so that the senators could urgently deal with a law that would allow the minister to continue to take such measures. But the Senate unanimously decided that Kuipers was putting pressure on the senators, and that an accelerated handling of the law should not be considered. Kuipers wrote in a letter sent on Friday to the Tweede Kamer, the lower house of Parliament, that he will now instruct the Kennemerland Security Region to enact the measures, also on behalf of Justice Minister Dilan Yesilgöz. Current law already allows for the situation to be handled in this way. Schiphol Airport is located in that security region. The Netherlands has 25 such regions.Kuipers had asked the Outbreak Management Team (OMT) and the Social Impact Team (MIT) for advice before announcing the restriction. According to the OMT, it is preferable that measures are aligned across Europe.However, there is not believed to be an additional threat to the Netherlands, because the population is largely believed to have a built-up immunity against the Omicron variant of the virus. According to research, most Chinese coronavirus patients are infected with some form of Omicron.The MIT thinks that the social impact of the new measure will be limited, because the measure has no effect on cargo transport. The numbers of airline passengers from China are also limited.",6 January 2023 - 19:03,Health

His speech was praised by Linda Nooitmeer from NiNsee, the national institute for the history of Dutch slavery, Rabin Baldewsingh, the National Coordinator against Discrimination and Racism, and Dagmar Oudshoorn, the chair of the former Slavery History Dialogue Group.In his Christmas speech, the king followed up on the apologies that Prime Minister Mark Rutte offered on behalf of the government last Monday. “No one now is to blame for the inhumane acts that were perpetrated on the lives of men, women and children,” said the king. “But by honestly facing our shared past and acknowledging the crime against humanity that was slavery, we are laying the foundations for a shared future.” He said the coming commemorative “will hold our attention,” and pledged he and Queen Maxima will “remain involved.”Linda Nooitmeer was impressed by the speech, she said in an initial reaction. ""I thought it was a very nice message. The king referred to the apologies, to the ‘crime against humanity’ and to descendants of people who lived in slavery. He also indicated that the commemoration year in 2023 has the attention of the Royal Family. I was pleased to hear that.""The king's overall message, “Let's keep holding on to each other, even in intense times with strong emotions,” touched Nooitmeer.""It is very important to embrace this history together,” Nooitmeer said.Rabin Baldewsingh found the emotion of the king's words to be noteworthy. ""In the end, this is what it's all about. It was really a very connecting speech."" As an example, Baldewsingh mentions the way in which the king used the impact of the slavery past to call on people to join in and participate. According to the National Coordinator against Discrimination and Racism, it is ""really great"" that the king underlined the apologies that Rutte has previously expressed with his words. ""I am very happy with these connecting words. It came across as very sincere. I think an important foundation has been laid for reconciliation towards the memorial year.""Dagmar Oudshoorn, is the director of Amnesty International Netherlands in addition to having chaired the Slavery History Dialogue Group. Oudshoorn also described the king’s words as being both beautiful and drawing connections. “I think the speech is very important for the descendants of enslaved people."" According to her, the king's words mainly reflected what the advisory body stated in its report 'Chains of the Past'. ""We have a shared past and we must also move towards a shared future.""Next year, from July 1, 2023 to July 1, 2024, will be the Commemoration Year of Slavery Past.

When requesting information about accounts held by notaries for clients, banks often ran up against the notaries' duty of confidentiality. It was now agreed that a statement by the notary about his or her own money laundering checks will suffice, reported the Dutch Banking Association (NVB).To combat money laundering or terrorist financing, banks are required to investigate the origin of the money held in client accounts. However, due to the duty of confidentiality, this is difficult in the case of so-called third-party money accounts of notary offices, which contain funds that do not belong to the notary or the office itself.It has now been decided that the bank no longer has to investigate the funds in these third-party accounts itself, but can rely on the statement of these accounts issued by a notary. This solution came about after the NVB consulted with the regulator Nederlandsche Bank and the Ministries of Justice and Security and Finance. Notaries must report each time they issue such a statement to the regulator for their sector, the Financial Supervision Bureau,.It is very important to banks to comply with the legal requirements for combating money laundering. Due to shortcomings in checks for possible criminal money flows, ING and ABN AMRO have already reached settlements of hundreds of millions of euros with the Public Prosecution Service.

66,https://nltimes.nl/2022/12/25/full-text-english-king-willem-alexanders-2022-christmas-speech,Full text in English of King Willem-Alexander's 2022 Christmas speech,"NL Times produced an English translation of King Willem-Alexander’s speech on Christmas Day, and also published an article summarizing the key portions of his annual televised address to the people of the Netherlands. It was his tenth such Christmas speech since ascending to the throne in April 2013.Many of you are under a shadow of worry this Christmas. “It's a tough time,” people tell me. Is there enough money to pay the bills now that everything has become so expensive? Where can I finally find a suitable home or a student room? And what about the future of my company?It is also a confrontational time, because isn’t climate change forcing us to make drastic choices? And are we not running up against restrictions in our country with its limited space and conflicting interests? We can feel it in our bones that we can no longer postpone difficult decisions. Patches and emergency bandages no longer help. It has to be different.That confronts us with the question of where we want to go from here. What kind of society do we really want, and how do we hold on to our values ​​- freedom, equality, social justice - on the way to a new stability?Very complicated! I understand the uncertainty that can be felt in many places, the stress and also the anger. It can then be a relief to let off some steam. But we must not get bogged down in scapegoating and cynical criticism or indifference.Democracy does not mean that those who shout the loudest get their way. Democracy means working together on solutions that the majority can identify with while respecting everyone's fundamental rights. This involves careful consideration of all interests.The latter is essential, for example in the relationship between rural and urban areas. It is high time to strengthen the connection. Because what would the Randstad be without the provincial regions? And the provincial regions without the Randstad? We desperately need each other.Let's try – wherever we live – to escape prejudice. Let's make sure we do not lose hold of each other! At least give each other the benefit of the doubt. My call to each and every one of you is: join in, listen in, think along, take part!Sometimes it can help to look outward and draw on the example of others. Like the Ukrainian people who for ten months now have been standing up with incredible courage and unity against the brutal violence by Russia. The promise of Christmas – the hope of peace – lives in all Ukrainian hearts, and in ours.The wisdom of the elderly can also provide inspiration. I am reminded of Gratitude, a short book by neurologist Oliver Sacks, written towards the end of his life. It made him happy to see young, talented people all around him. “The future is in good hands,” he writes.""The future is in good hands."" I'd like to tell him. I meet them everywhere. Young people with ideals and imagination. They feel jointly responsible and are prepared to take the future on their shoulders.There is so much resilience in the young generation! But young people cannot do it alone. They rightly say, “Don't put it all on us. Listen to us, give us space, trust us, help us, but take personal responsibility and live up to it.”We don't always realize it, but we are capable of so much more than we think. I am convinced that we can also successfully conclude very complex problems and heal painful wounds, so that we can move forward together. Even when there are intense emotions involved.An important example of this is the acknowledgment of the suffering inflicted on people during the colonial era.Over the past year, my wife and I have spoken to people of all ages about this topic, including descendants of people who lived in slavery several generations ago. In the upcoming commemorative year, this will keep our focus. We will remain involved.No one now is to blame for the inhumane acts that were perpetrated on the lives of men, women and children. But by honestly facing our shared past and acknowledging the crime against humanity that was slavery, we are laying the foundations for a shared future.A future in which we stand against all contemporary forms of discrimination, exploitation and injustice.The apologies offered by the Cabinet are the beginning of a long road. Let's keep holding on to each other, even in intense times with strong emotions.Marieke Lucas Rijneveld wrote her own poem when, after a fuss, he decided against translating The Hill We Climb after some commotion. It is called Alles bewoonbaar. A combination of empathy, hope and belief in our future together.These are the last lines:Jij wil juist verbroedering, je wil één vuist, en wellicht is je handnu nog niet krachtig genoeg, of moet je eerst die van de ander vastpakken om te verzoenen, moet je daadwerkelijk de hoop voelendat je iets doet wat de wereld zal verbeteren, al moet je dit nietvergeten: kom na het knielen weer overeind en recht samen de rug.I wish you all – wherever you are and whatever your personal circumstances – a blessed Christmas celebration.The poet, Marieke Lucas Rijneveld, who became the first Dutch winner of the International Booker Prize in 2020, was initially asked to translate Amanda Gorman’s poem The Hill We Climb, which she recited at the 2021 inauguration of U.S. President Joe Biden. Instead, Rijneveld composed his own poem, Alles bewoonbaar, or Everything Inhabitable. The portion cited by Willem-Alexander was translated by Michele Hutchinson as:what you want is fraternity, you want one fist, and maybe yourhand isn’t yet powerful enough, or maybe you should first take the handof another in reconciliation, you actively need to feel the hope thatyou are doing something to improve the world, though you mustn’tforget this: stand up again after kneeling and straighten together our backs.An English translation was published by The Guardian.",25 December 2022 - 14:27,Politics

The speech was recorded in the DNA Salon of the Huis ten Bosch palace in The Hague several days before it was broadcast on December 25.Dutch King Willem-Alexander used his Christmas address on Sunday to discuss why the Netherlands must now face up to its history involving slavery, while also acknowledging people’s fears about money amid a year of exceedingly high inflation and expensive energy bills. The speech of just over six minutes, was more specific than in past years, though also continued with his consistent message of being more accepting and understanding of people’s differences.“Let's try – wherever we live – to escape prejudice. Let's make sure we do not lose each other. At least give each other the benefit of the doubt,” he said. “My call to each of you and each of you is: hook up, listen in, think along, join in.”Along those lines, Willem-Alexander used what was perhaps his most specific Christmas address to call on people to reject “discrimination, exploitation and injustice,” while pledging that he and Queen Maxima will be firmly involved in how the Netherlands addresses the country’s history of slavery. Prime Minister Mark Rutte formally apologized on behalf of the Dutch State for how the Netherlands supported the slave trade, and said Willem-Alexander would take part in a ceremony commemorating the 150th anniversary of the total abolition of slavery in the Kingdom at an event in Amsterdam on July 1.“Over the past year, my wife and I have spoken to people of all ages about this topic, including descendants of people who lived in slavery several generations ago,” Willem-Alexander said. “No one now can be blamed for the inhumane acts that were perpetrated on the lives of men, women and children. But by honestly facing our shared past and acknowledging the crime against humanity that was slavery, we are laying the foundations for a shared future. A future in which we stand against all contemporary forms of discrimination, exploitation and injustice.”He also put special emphasis on how many people in the Netherlands are faced with new worries this Christmas, brought on by a variety of issues the country’s residents were not faced with just one year ago. Willem-Alexander said he knows it is a ""confrontational time,"" where residents are afraid they cannot pay the bills, or afford what they have grown accustomed to in previous years do to the rising cost of living. He also acknowledged the difficulties many people face with housing, including students, and entrepreneurs trying desperately to keep their businesses running.He implored on people not to let the stress and anger boil over in such a way where people lash out at others when blowing off steam. ""But we must not get bogged down in scapegoating and cynical criticism or indifference,"" he said. ""Democracy does not mean that those who shout the loudest get their way. Democracy means working together with respect for everyone's fundamental rights on solutions that the majority can identify with,"" he continued.In light of this, he asked that people continue to join in and participate in society, and to be more accepting of different perspectives and opinions. “Sometimes it can help to look outward and draw on the example of others, like the Ukrainian people who have been standing up against the brutal violence by Russia for ten months now, with incredible courage and unity. The promise of Christmas – the hope of peace – lives in all Ukrainian hearts, and in ours.”The king also spoke in praise of the younger generations of the Netherlands with a reference to neurologist and author Oliver Sacks, who noted “The future is in good hands,” in his book, Gratitude.”I meet them everywhere. Young people with ideals and imagination,” the king said. “They feel jointly responsible and are prepared to take the future on their shoulders.”Early in his speech, Willem Alexander also addressed the questions about climate change and the need to “make drastic decisions” where the country is bumping up against limitations on space and conflicting interests. “We feel it in our bones that we can no longer postpone difficult decisions. Patches and emergency bandages no longer help. It has to be different.”The speech was Willem-Alexander’s tenth Christmas address as King of the Netherlands, a role he took on after his mother, Beatrix, stepped down in April 2013. The speech was recorded in the DNA Salon, a room within his present residence, the Huis ten Bosch Palace.Formerly known as the Green Salon, the DNA Salon was renovated between 2016-2019 to include tens of thousands of bricks.

In the speech, which was recorded on Thursday, the king traditionally looks back on the past year and ahead to the new year.
This year's speech was recorded in the DNA Salon at Huis ten Bosch Palace. The king's year-end speech can be seen on Christmas Day at 1 p.m. on NPO 1, RTL4 and SBS6 and can be listened to on NPO Radio 1.On NPO 2, the speech can be seen with a sign language interpreter.Last year, about 1.6 million people watched the king’s Christmas speech. That was slightly less than a year earlier, when 2.2 million people tuned in. In his speech in 2021, King Willem-Alexander referred to the Covid-19 pandemic. For example, he said that Christmas that year is ""forced to be so much more austere and quieter than we all hoped"". The Dutch king also recalled a visit to a hospital where he spoke to a nurse about the impact of the pandemic. ""A show of strength that day for all the wonderful doctors, nurses and health care workers who work tirelessly to keep us healthy,"" he emphasized. The king also mentioned other encounters he has had with ""different"" people over the past year. ""Each of us has our own story. After all, we are very different people.

84,https://nltimes.nl/2022/12/25/cabinet-proposes-new-law-ban-parties-undermine-democracy,Cabinet proposes new law to ban parties that undermine democracy ,"The Cabinet published a new bill that would allow political parties to be banned if they undermine the democratic rule of law, or if they propose abolishing the rule of law. If the bill is passed, it will mean that courts can impose a ban ""as a last resort if a party wants to destroy democracy,"" according to Interior Minister Hanke Bruins Slot.It is already possible to ban a political party, but on different grounds than what was written into the new bill. This is now only possible if a party poses a threat to public order - as is the case for other organizations, such as motorcycle gangs. The new Political Parties Act, as the bill is officially called, is much more specific.Minister Bruins Slot said she considers parties ""of vital importance."" In a statement, she added, ""The parties that also gain our trust with our votes must never endanger our democracy in the process.""
Ideally, the power to ban parties should rest with a constitutional court, but that does not yet exist in the Netherlands. In the current proposal, the Supreme Court addresses this.If it were up to the Cabinet, the court would soon be allowed to ban parties if they preach violence and use violence to dismantle democracy or violate fundamental rights. The rules are strict, as had been recommended in several expert opinions. Ultimately, the European Court of Human Rights can review whether the party in question should have been banned.The new law regulates more than just the ban on parties. It also contains stricter rules on the transparency of political parties, for example in the area of their finances and internal organization.Furthermore, political parties active in municipalities, water associations and provinces will receive additional funding: more than 25 million euros over a three-year period. ""This will make parties less dependent on donations,"" the minister said. A newly established law on the Political Parties Authority Act is to provide oversight.This law is largely the result of the work of a committee led by Johan Remkes, which issued policy advice in 2018. The proposal is currently in consultation, which means that everyone, both experts and citizens, can respond to the law until 22 March. Only later will the proposal be discussed in the Tweede Kamer.",25 December 2022 - 08:10,Politics

Wages that rose due to new collective bargaining agreements and more working hours played an especially important role in this, according to the CBS. At the same time, mortgage debt also increased.Real disposable income rose by 0.8 percent. That's the increase in disposable income adjusted for price increases. Income for both employees and the self-employed was higher than in the third quarter of 2021, with total compensation of employees rising 8.3 percent. Also the number of working hours grew 3.2 percent, while collectively agreed wages increased 3.4 percentThe increase in total benefits received was 5.1 percent. Furthermore, low-income households received compensation for higher energy prices, and more state pension benefits were paid. Households on the other hand, paid 2.8 percent more in taxes and social security contributions.The total mortgage debt for all Dutch people rose by 7.3 billion euros, bringing the total mortgage debt to 811.5 billion euros, CBS reported. In the process, the debt ratio, total mortgage debt as a percentage of the size of the economy, went down. It now stands at 88.2 percent. This is the lowest level since the third quarter of 2003.In general, the lower debt ratio is caused by stronger growth in gross domestic product (GDP) than in total mortgage debt.",25 December 2022 - 07:30,Business

The programs serve as a supplementary benefit in addition to government subsidies and social benefits, reported NOS. The aim of this measure was not only to support low-income and the poorest families, but also people in the lower-middle income range, who were also affected by the current economic situation in the Netherlands. Among the 60 programs, different target groups and additional needs were covered. For example, pet owners in Amsterdam were eligible for free veterinary visits. Residents of Echt-Susteren, Limburg, receive a birthday voucher, and in the Zuid-Holland town Zwijndrecht, families were provided 75 euros in dressing allowance per child. In addition, AOW affected people in Capelle aan den IJssel were able to use public transportation for free, according to NOS.Also this year, the municipalities have invested a lot of money in social assistance, even more than in the previous year, because more people had to take advantage of the assistance due to the high inflation and the consequences of the energy crisis. Above all, income support measures were provided by more than 50 Dutch municipalities, which used an income standard in allocating the energy subsidy of 1300 euros, which was more flexible than the usual 120 percent of the social assistance standard, wrote NOS. However, the regulations differ by municipality. Accordingly, the amount and the possibility of income support depend on where people live in the Netherlands. ",24 December 2022 - 11:55,Politics

The new unit will now also focus on personal security of ministers, judges, public prosecutors and lawyers. The extended protection came about because the Marechaussee was under pressure as more and more people needed to be secured.
This is because threats from terrorist circles, which the Marechaussee say have always existed, were joined by threats from criminal circles, they told KMarMagazine. In addition, increasing unrest in society, for example in connection with Covid-19 and the farmers protests, and a general hardening in society also play a role. Furthermore, the unit can also be deployed abroad if necessary.Currently, the Royal and Diplomatic Security Service of the National Police is still mainly responsible for personal protection at home. The first group of this new unit will begin training in January and will consist of members of the military police themselves. The goal is to train a total of five classes in 2024 and 2025.For this purpose, the Ministry of Justice and Security has earmarked millions of euros for the National Police, the Public Prosecution Service, the NCTV and the Marechaussee to further strengthen the Surveillance and Security system.",24 December 2022 - 10:01,Politics

A wide majority in the Tweede Kamer supported the law, which is meant to modernize the country’s pension system by making it more flexible and more accessible to all adults from the age of 18, while making it easier to accrue a pension almost immediately when starting work.The law will almost certainly help the 1.2 million people who are registered as self-employed with the Dutch Chamber of Commerce. If the bill passes the Eerste Kamer, the upper House of Parliament, it will mean self-employed people can put more money into their personal pension holdings every year with more tax advantages.Self-employed people will be able to earmark a maximum of 30 percent of their profits before paying income tax into their pension. Currently, they can put 13.3 percent of the money earned annually into their pension without paying income tax on the contribution.It means that those whose income place them in the upper tax brackets can contribute 10,000 euros into their pension, but will effectively pay 5,050 euros net to do so because of the tax breaks received, said Oskar Barendse from Knab Bank. “It doesn’t get any cheaper than that. The only condition is that you invest in a third pillar product, like pension savings, investments, or annuity insurance,” he said.Additionally, Barendse noted that pension funds will be able to take on self-employed people with no employees as clients when the new law passes the Eerste Kamer and takes effect in the Netherlands. Already, about a third of self-employed people are expected to save with a pension fund if they gain access to them, Barendse said based on internal research from Knab. “Whether this is wise is highly questionable. Much is still unclear about this part of the plan, as such a fund is often more expensive than if you yourself invest in a pension savings account, for example.”The Tweede Kamer spent dozens of hours debating the complex bill in the run-up to the vote, including separate votes on dozens of amendments earlier in the week. The bill creates a foundation for a new way of handling the national pension assets of about 1.5 trillion euros, which will no longer be handled collectively, but in more individual funds.The new system is meant to be more protective of how people engage in work now, which is often more flexible and changing over the course of a career than in the past. At the same time, the new system may introduce more risk.The ruling coalition parties voted in favor of the law in a roll call vote in the Tweede Kamer, along with left-wing opposition parties GroenLinks and PvdA. Although SGP and Volt also signed on, the left-wing parties will be critical in winning passage in the Eerste Kamer, where the coalition does not have a majority.The composition of the Eerste Kamer will also change next year as it is determined by the results of the provincial elections in May. For that reason, the Cabinet will want to see the bill taken up more quickly after the Christmas and New Year’s recess. Three of the parties in the coalition, VVD, D66 and CDA, are polling much worse now than just after the last Tweede Kamer election in March 2021.",24 December 2022 - 08:15,Politics

Much is still unclear about this part of the plan, as such a fund is often more expensive than if you yourself invest in a pension savings account, for example.”The Tweede Kamer spent dozens of hours debating the complex bill in the run-up to the vote, including separate votes on dozens of amendments earlier in the week. The bill creates a foundation for a new way of handling the national pension assets of about 1.5 trillion euros, which will no longer be handled collectively, but in more individual funds.The new system is meant to be more protective of how people engage in work now, which is often more flexible and changing over the course of a career than in the past. At the same time, the new system may introduce more risk.The ruling coalition parties voted in favor of the law in a roll call vote in the Tweede Kamer, along with left-wing opposition parties GroenLinks and PvdA. Although SGP and Volt also signed on, the left-wing parties will be critical in winning passage in the Eerste Kamer, where the coalition does not have a majority.The composition of the Eerste Kamer will also change next year as it is determined by the results of the provincial elections in May. For that reason, the Cabinet will want to see the bill taken up more quickly after the Christmas and New Year’s recess. Three of the parties in the coalition, VVD, D66 and CDA, are polling much worse now than just after the last Tweede Kamer election in March 2021.",24 December 2022 - 08:15,Business

The Cabinet decided on this measure at the end of August. With the appeal, the Cabinet wants a final decision on whether or not the scheme is legally tenable.This month, several courts ruled in five cases to allow people recognized refugees to bring their family members to the Netherlands. The refugees in those cases include a Syrian woman, a Turkish man and an Iraqi woman. Each and every one of the court rulings stated that the government measure to limit the family reunification of refugees is illegal. According to the judges, the regulation is in violation of both national and international treaties, including the European Convention on Human RightsAfter the first ruling at the beginning of December, State Secretary Eric Van der Burg, who is responsible for the policy, maintained the restriction on travel in connection with family members of recognized refugees. He said the preliminary relief judge had not ruled on the family reunification order as a whole, but on a specific case.After a verdict handed down Thursday, Van der Burg said that he would not rule out an appeal to the Council of State. After studying the five judgments published this month, the Cabinet decided on Friday to appeal to the Council of State in order to obtain clarity from the highest administrative court about the restriction on travel in connection with family reunification.The restriction on family reunification applies to family members of people who are already in the Netherlands. The Cabinet decided at the end of August that a visa will be issued up to fifteen months after the application for family reunification has been submitted.However, if the status holder manages to secure a home for his or her relatives traveling in the Netherlands, the visa may be issued earlier. The measure applies up to and including 2023 and, according to the Cabinet, is necessary to relieve the pressure on the overburdened asylum reception system.",23 December 2022 - 18:11,Politics

This can help stem the loss of purchasing power due to high energy prices, he said on the news program Nieuwsuur.Knot said he made some calculations that showed wages could increase by 5 to 7 percent. He stressed, however, that this is an average. It is not the case that companies in all sectors are doing equally well and have the same room to maneuver everywhere. In fact, some sectors are actually suffering greatly from high energy prices. ""But there are also sectors that are showing record profitability, such as trade and manufacturing.”DNB already published new economic estimates earlier this week. These showed that the labor market will remain extremely tight for the time being, with unemployment rising only slightly. This means that the need for personnel will continue in many sectors. DNB Chief Economist Olaf Sleijpen also believed that there is still room for additional wage increases in many sectors.
That is not to say, however, that employers should fully compensate for inflation with the wages they pay. DNB has been warning for some time that automatic wage indexation - something that unions, for example, would like to see - is not a good idea, because that could actually boost inflation even higher.
In that case there would be a so-called wage-price spiral, in which people would spend considerably more and thus encourage companies to raise their prices further. For now, DNB does not yet have the impression that such a scenario is imminent.",23 December 2022 - 09:40,Business

Already earlier this week, the vote was expected to pass the lower House of Parliament, after a number of amendments were approved by a majority at the request of parties which were on the fence.As a result, the law passed by a large 93-48 majority thanks to the backing of the coalition parties, which were joined by SGP, Volt, PvdA, and GroenLinks. Both of the latter parties were needed for passage through the Eerste Kamer, the Dutch Senate.There was wide agreement that the current pension system was out of date. The bill is meant to make the system more flexible and in line with the current labor market trends by shifting the massive 1.4 to 1.5 trillion euros in pension assets from one collective pot to more individual pension funds. One goal is that young workers, including those on temporary and flexible contracts, can build up their pensions from a younger age and more rapidly. Additionally, pensions should be able to be indexed in line with inflation more readily if the investments perform well.Concerns include a higher level of risk that the pension funds may now face. Additionally, politicians want guarantees that the transition to the new system will not damage the standing of middle-aged workers.To win over PvdA and GroenLinks, the coalition compromised on three important amendments. Working people should be able to start building up a pension from the age of 18, instead of 21. A waiting period will be eliminated so temporary and flexible workers can immediately accrue their pension. Additionally, if the bill becomes a law, the Cabinet must quickly address the situation if it turns out that segments of the working population are not growing their pensions fast enough.Pension minister Carola Schouten said she was pleased with the results. She called it the “most extensive” handling of a bill in her career. “And that's good, because the law has improved through all those debates.""To become a law, the measure may have to be quickly taken up in the Senate after the Christmas and New Year’s recess. The provincial elections in May will determine the composition of the Senate. Support for Prime Minister Mark Rutte’s VVD, the largest party, has fallen steadily since last July, as has support for the second largest party, D66, which is also in the coalition. Support for the CDA has also dropped off. Meanwhile, support for the PVV, BBB, and Ja21 has been rising, and both PvdA and GroenLinks seem to be trending more positively in polling over the last year.",23 December 2022 - 08:34,Politics

Former Dutch women’s national football trainer Sarina Wiegman was awarded best coach by the BBC for her work with England’s national football team.Irene Schouten, the 30-year-old skater from Noord-Holland, was the undisputed queen of the Beijing Winter Olympics last winter. She took home three gold medals and a bronze medal.She received the most votes from her fellow top athletes and the professional jury taking part in the ceremony, and received the accompanying Jaap Eden Award. Former professional footballer Ruud Gullit presented the award during the gala in AFAS Live.Schouten succeeds athlete Sifan Hassan, who was not nominated this year. Two-time Olympic short track champion Suzanne Schulting and cycling world champion Annemiek van Vleuten were the other two nominees.Schouten was practically unbeatable last skating season and showed her dominance in the long distances in Beijing with gold in the 3,000 meters, 5,000 meters and mass start. Her bronze came in the team pursuit. She became the most successful Dutch athlete ever at a single Winter Games with her presence on the podium. A month after the Games, to her own surprise, she also won the world all-round title.The professional jury had difficulty choosing three nominees this year. There was no unanimous decision. For example, three-time European athletics champion Femke Bol and skater Ireen Wüst, the most successful Dutch Olympian ever, dropped out.""This means a lot, because what those other athletes have achieved is also not normal,"" said Schouten. Ninety percent of the people around me thought I should do things differently, but I believed in it.""Race car driver Max Verstappen has been chosen as Sportsman of the Year for the third time. The 25-year-old Limburger won the world title in Formula 1 this year for the second straight season. He received the most votes in the election from his fellow athletes and the professional jury.The Red Bull Racing driver won the election against two other nominated athletes, multiple track cycling world champion Harrie Lavreysen and Olympic speed skating champion Thomas Krol.Verstappen himself was not present at the Sports Gala. His younger sister Victoria was in Amsterdam to represent him, and accepted the accompanying Jaap Eden Award on his behalf. It was presented by skating icon Ireen Wüst.Verstappen was previously Sportsman of the Year in 2016 and 2021. In 2016 he was the first Dutch winner of a Formula 1 race, and was also the youngest ever F1 driver to win a race. Last year he received the honorary title for accomplishing his first world title in the premier class of motorsport.This year he extended his title with a record fifteen grand prix victories. In addition, together with his Mexican teammate Sergio Pérez, he gave the Red Bull racing team the Constructors' Championship.After the ceremony, a video followed in which numerous drivers and former drivers from Formula 1 congratulated Verstappen, including Jackie Stewart, Nelson Piquet, Mark Webber, Nico Hülkenberg and Damon Hill.Short track trainer Jeroen Otter was chosen as Coach of the Year at the Sports Gala. He celebrated successes with the women who took part at the Winter Games in Beijing, including gold for Suzanne Schulting in the 1,000 meters and gold for the relay team in the 3,000 meters relay.After the Beijing Games, Otter decided to take a sabbatical. He has been employed by the skating association since 2010 and under his leadership the Netherlands has become one of the leading countries in short track speed skating. Otter called the relay team's gold his ""most beautiful title"" at the Games.The 58-year-old Otter had been nominated before, but now saw his years of dedication to Dutch short track rewarded with the top Coach Award. He received the most votes from his fellow coaches and the professional jury and won the election of the two other nominees: national rowing coach Eelco Meenhorst and football coach Sarina Wiegman.However, Sarina Wiegman was named coach of the year during the BBC Sports Personality of the Year held in England. The former Oranje national coach won the European Championship in women's football with England this year.""I feel honored, but also appropriately humbled,” she said to the BBC after winning the award. ""I never could have accomplished this without an amazing group of players. And we had a great staff. It was awesome. I’m lucky to work with these players.""Wiegman also won the European Championship one time as coach of the Dutch women’s football team.",22 December 2022 - 09:05,Sports

Owner occupied homes sold in November cost nearly 1 percent less on average than in October, according to data released on Thursday by Statistics Netherlands (CBS).After years of sharp, dramatic increases in housing prices, a peak was reached in July. The average sales price began to fall because of a combination of factors, mainly the rising mortgage interest rates. That makes it harder for buyers to put together the financing needed to purchase more expensive properties.Overall, the Dutch Central Bank predicted that home prices will fall by about 3 percent in 2023 and 3 percent in 2024. That exceeds predictions from ABN Amro and ING, which both predicted a 2.5 percent fall in 2023.Despite the decrease in November, homes still sold for prices that were 4.9 percent higher than 12 months earlier. That reflected the lowest year-on-year increase in over six years, the CBS said. The year-on-year increase recently peaked at over 21 percent at the start of 2022.After the economic crisis, home sales prices hit a low point in June 2013. Since then, prices have jumped by nearly 95 percent.Additionally, the number of residential real estate transactions have been falling. The Dutch real estate registry, Kadaster, was informed of 15,146 housing transactions in November. That was about 6 percent fewer than a year earlier.“In the first 11 months of 2022, 171,767 homes were sold, down more than 1.6 percent than in the same period of 2021,” the CBS said.",22 December 2022 - 07:32,Business

His DNA was found on the weapon used in the murder, and in the car used by the two suspected perpetratorsthe OM said. The Public Prosecution Service explained their allegations in detail during an introductory session against the six suspects in the controversial murder case, which essentially restarted on Friday.In October 2021, Konrad W. came into the picture as detectives pressed ahead with the investigation. He likely returned to his homeland at the end of that year. Police in Poland tracked him down at the request of the Netherlands, and arrested him on September 26 last year. He was handed over to the Netherlands on October 12, and on Friday he had to appear in court for the first time during the public hearing in Amsterdam.According to the OM, he is complicit in the murder. W. was allegedly involved in the delivery of firearms, a getaway car and a bottle of petrol to set the vehicle on fire after the murder. The man did not want to testify, and invoked his right to remain silent.Peter R. de Vries was 64 years of age when he was shot on July 6, 2021 on the Lange Leidsedwarsstraat in the center of Amsterdam. He died nine days later. The two men accused of carrying out the assassination attempt, 36-year-old Kamil E. from Poland and 23-year-old Delano G. from Rotterdam, were caught soon after the assassination attempt. Last summer, the police arrested another four suspects, three of whom are still in custody. Among them is Krystian M. (27), who is said to have orchestrated the apparent contract killing.M. and W. are said to belong to a group of Polish people who are guilty of committing serious crimes. At the time of his arrest, M. was already in jail for a failed assassination attempt in Zeewolde. He too is remaining silent. In the courtroom, he wore a face mask and hid under the hood of a sweatshirt.Last year, the Public Prosecution Service demanded life imprisonment against G., who is suspected of pulling the trigger, and E., who is accused of driving the getaway car. The court was forced to postpone the verdict at the last minute and reopen the proceedings into the two after the Public Prosecution Service produced a new witness.This witness, numbered 5089, claims to be a friend of Krystian M. and reportedly made numerous explosive statements during interrogations. He was extensively questioned last month and those interrogations will continue this month. His statements suggested that Ridouan Taghi should be seen as the person who commissioned the murder of De Vries. Taghi's attorney previously rejected this accusation.During the delay caused by postponing the verdict, one of the judges on the panel pressed forward with plans to leave their job and relocate abroad. The situation required the court to order a mistrial. Last year, the court also decided to handle the cases against the two known suspects and the four new suspects all in one trial. It is not yet known when the substantive hearings in the trial will begin.",6 January 2023 - 12:22,Crime

They did not find anything suspicious.Technically, the courier did not commit a felony or a serious crime. The only illegal act was parking in a no-parking zone. “There will be a good conversation between him and his employer,” the Marechaussee spokesperson speculated.The owner of the courier company was caught completely unaware, and did not know the delivery worker had even planned a trip.

The cold case team hopes that releasing the 65-year-old victim’s name will help them make contact with his family. Passersby found the torso, wrapped in blue plastic, floating in the IJ near the NDSM estate in Amsterdam-Noord on January 30, 2013. The police’s cold case team reopened the case last year. The team quickly identified the victim as the missing art dealer but did not release his name because his family had not yet been informed.Due to the war in Ukraine, the Dutch police have no contact with the Russian authorities. They hope that by now releasing Levin’s name, his family will make contact with them. According to the Telegraaf, Levin was involved in trading art and antiquities. In 1999, he was convicted of art smuggling. He spent a lot of time in Amsterdam.The Dutch police are still investigating Levin’s murder. One of the theories they’re working on is that Levin became the victim of extortion by a Russian gang or the Russian secret service, the newspaper wrote. ",6 January 2023 - 10:30,Crime

In 2021, there were 628 honor-related violence cases, and in 2018 there were 529. According to the police, the upward trend in this type of violence is mainly related to the influx of migrants and refugees.Over 20 percent of the honor-violence incidents in the past two years happened in the Dutch-Syrian community, the police told the newspaper. According to the police, that is logical, given the many people who fled the war in Syria in recent years. Before that, most cases happened in Turkish and Moroccan circles. Honor-violence involves violent incidents to protect or restore the “sullied honor” of the family, for example, if a family member is accused of unchaste behavior by their partner or another family. Resistance to choosing a partner, extramarital relations, or opposition to following family rules can also spark these types of incidents.The honor-violence incidents the police handled in recent years included threats, stalking, assault, forced marriage, abduction, and even manslaughter.",6 January 2023 - 09:41,Crime

That is why we need to put greater pressure on this regime.”The parties want the Netherlands to submit a proposal to the EU to put the Iranian Revolutionary Guards on the list of terrorist organizations. They also called for sanctions against “specific persons from the Iranian regime and their close relatives,” as has happened before with powerful Russians. “In this way, we prevent them from violating freedoms in Iran and then coming here to enjoy our freedoms at, for example, our universities. And in this way, we protect Iranians here so that they are not confronted with (family members of) their oppressors from Iran.”The parties also called for better enforcement of sanctions, including improving information sharing and punishing countries if they help Iranians evade sanctions. The security services should better inform companies “so that an entrepreneur can also find out whether a company in Dubai is actually an Iranian company evading the sanctions.” In addition, Iranians in Europe must be better protected against threats and intimidation from the Iranian government.The opinion piece follows a motion in parliament to put the Iranian Revolutionary Guards on the list of terrorist organizations. Only Forum voor Democratie voted against the motion. The leaders of the coalition parties VVD, D66, CDA, and ChristenUnie, and opposition parties PvdA, SP, GroenLinks, Denk, JA21, and SGP all signed the opinion piece.",6 January 2023 - 08:03,Politics

According to a first estimate by Statistics Netherlands (CBS), inflation was 9.6 percent last month. In November, consumer goods and services were still 9.9 percent more expensive than twelve months earlier. Since the outbreak of war in Ukraine, life has rapidly become more expensive. But lately, prices have been rising a bit less sharply. December was the third month in a row that inflation was lower than the month before. That is entirely due to the prices of gas and electricity. They spiked earlier last year but have recently decreased. However, energy is still considerably more expensive than a year ago. The decrease in inflation is not noticeable in supermarkets. The pace at which food, beverages, and tobacco prices rise was slightly higher in December than in November. Inflation of these products amounted to 14 percent last month, compared to 12.9 percent the month before.Statistics Netherlands stressed that this estimate is based on incomplete data.

He is described on the national wanted list as ""one of the most notorious and cruelest human traffickers in the world.""Kidane was the head of a camp in Libya that housed thousands of migrants. His victims had to deal with aggravated assault, kidnapping, rape, and other violent crimes. Many did not survive the journey to Europe and even if his victims did arrive in the Netherlands, he would then extort his victims by making them pay money to ensure the survival of the next family member who was on their way to Europe.The man was previously detained in Ethiopia, but managed to escape during a hearing ahead of his trial in 2021. In absentia, he was sentenced to life imprisonment in Ethiopia for human trafficking in Africa.

The group threw fireworks at the trapped officers and someone threatened them with a prohibited type of baton, the police reported on January 1.A number of residents of 's-Gravendeel who were injured during the intervention of the ME complain about the actions of the ME in a report produced by broadcaster Rijnmond. According to them, the riot police were in the wrong, and they attacked people who were not among the rioters. They therefore wrongly fell victim to police violence.According to the victims, the riot police intervened out of the blue and there had been a friendly atmosphere on the street. Several people said they were severely beaten. They did not know why the ME was present in the village.

The Netherlands is not among them, and has said a European-wide decision is preferable.The four European countries are taking precautions partly because the European Union said on Wednesday evening in new advice about China that tests are, “Strongly recommended.” It was also advised to wear face masks on flights from China and to test the wastewater from planes from China. However, there has been no law laid down for all of Europe. After mass protests, China finally let their draconian restrictions go, and infections have surged since. Beijing resents countries introducing travel restrictions that only apply to travelers from China and warned against countermeasures earlier this week. It is unknown what those measures will be.EU member states France, Italy, and Spain had already decided on mandatory testing. Belgium announced shortly after the European meeting on Wednesday that they will also require a negative test for travelers from China. For now, this only applies to direct flights. The Netherlands, for now, is sticking with self-testing and advising people to go into isolation if their self-test is positive.Other countries that require a negative coronavirus test from travelers from China are Australia, Canada, India, Israel, Japan, Qatar, Taiwan, the United States, the United Kingdom, and South Korea.

A beamer was used to project the text, “White Lives Matter”, in blue letters onto the facade of the building on the Prinsessensingel on December 28. A video was shared on Telegram linking that action with one in which the text was shown in green on the Primark, as well as placing stickers promoting the White Lives Matter's social media channel.Scholten said on Thursday that he thinks it was both ""reprehensible,"" and not in common with the typical Venlo resident.The Public Prosecution Service (OM) is pursuing a criminal investigation for the incident in Rotterdam, which the office considers an act of hate speech. The words seen on the Erasmus Bridge thus not considered to be protected as a form of freedom of speech. “One of the boundaries is that expressions are never permitted to incite discrimination or insult another population group,” said the OM earlier this week.A spokesperson for the OM in Limburg could not say much on Thursday about what the office will do next.

According to data from insurance company Interpolis, there was a 39 percent increase compared to 2022. Interpolis said this was because of the coronavirus, the flu, and the worker shortage, which stacked more work pressure on other colleagues. Interpolis has said it is worrying that the number of people absent for a long time rose in 2022 compared to 2021 and the years before the coronavirus pandemic. The insurer said that the staff shortage is the main reason for that. Interpolis tated that a quarter of SME owners are worried about the health of their staff. “We continue to see the worries from SME owners about having and retaining enough staff through the year. When an organization struggles with not enough personnel, it creates added work pressure for its current employees,” said Rene Voets at Interpolis.Eventually, the increased pressure becomes too great, and employees either quit or go on leave, “which then increases the workload even more for other employees.”Interpolis expects the high work pressure to remain an important topic this year. The insurance company advises entrepreneurs to speak about this with staff. “Only this way can you keep a grip on it with employees, and you can see how you could divide the work pressure in a timely fashion to stop lengthy absences.”",5 January 2023 - 15:00,Health

Slightly less than half of those victims were boys under the age of 18.At least 32 finger amputations were performed. The doctors also treated many broken bones, eye injuries and serious burns. Legal fireworks injured ten people. ""Just like in previous years,"" illegal fireworks were the biggest culprit, the NVPC concluded on the basis of a survey among plastic surgeons in the country. Incidentally, fifteen of the victims were hurt before 6 p.m. on December 31, the moment when it became legal to set off fireworks in most municipalities.During the New Year's period from 2019 into 2020, the plastic surgeons treated fifty victims. One year prior there were 44 people with serious injuries.""It is worrying that we are now back at that level,"" said plastic surgeon Annekatrien van de Kar.

When the year 2020 came to an end, eighteen people were seriously injured, and the following year the figure was almost forty.Plastic surgeons often treat the most serious injuries, said Van de Kar.

The debris was scattered over an area of several hundred meters. Firefighters said traffic was being allowed to continue through the area, though AD said a bike path was blocked.The newspaper said parts landed on the verge of the road and against the dike. According to ANP, the roadway was restricted to local traffic at times.The wind turbine is about 20 years old, reported AD. The other windmills along the dike will also be inspected as a result of the accident.Our technical crew is “on their way and will soon investigate the exact cause. We are now discussing how to get rid of the mill. At the moment the wind is too strong to do that in a safe way,” said Geertjan Veenstra of the Flevoland Security Region to AD.",4 January 2023 - 12:55,One-one-two

There was an increase of 227,000 inhabitants, compared to 115,000 in 2021, according to the statistics office. With this growth, the number of inhabitants in the Netherlands stands at 17.8 million.In 2022, about 168,000 children were born, a reduction of over 11,000 from 2021 figures. About 169,000 people died last year. As a result, birth and death rates have remained about the same, so that population growth can be fully attributed to foreign immigration.A relatively high number of immigrants were registered last year, when about 402,000 people moved to the Netherlands. That is 150,000 more than in 2021. In every municipality the number of immigrants was higher than the number of emigrants.The larger cities in the Netherlands grew the fastest. Eindhoven and Almere had the strongest growth with 22 new people per thousand inhabitants. Of the major cities, only Rotterdam and Breda were slightly below the national average. The data does show that more people emigrated out of the Netherlands than moved to the Netherlands in the major cities, especially in the Randstad, but also Groningen and Eindhoven.Seven municipalities showed a per capita increase above 30 new inhabitants per thousand, where the national average was 13 per thousand. The seven municipalities include the Noordoostpolder, Waddinxveen, Diemen, Maassluis, Woudenberg and the islands of Vlieland and Schiermonnikoog.The number of inhabitants decreased in only nine of the 344 municipalities, which is less than in previous years. In 2020, the population fell in 61 municipalities. These municipalities were mainly located at the perimeter of the Netherlands, such as the coastal areas, or at the borders with Belgium and Germany.About 100,000 of the immigrants arrived from Ukraine after the Russian invasion in February. Some 89,000 of them have registered with a Dutch municipality since February. Many Ukrainians have also left the Netherlands, mainly back to Ukraine.After Ukraine, the most immigrants who settled in the Netherlands arrived from Syria, followed by Turkey, India and Poland.Without immigration, many municipalities would have experienced a contraction: 62 percent of them had a mortality rate that was higher than the birth rate. That figure was 53 percent in 2021, and the number has risen sharply in twenty years. In 2002, just 13 municipalities reported a death rate that outpaced new births.Since then, the number of municipalities has also decreased, because many municipalities have merged. The municipalities where more babies are born than people die are mainly in Flevoland, the Randstad region, and in and around Zwolle.Flevoland is the province where the population is growing the fastest, followed by Noord-Holland, Zuid-Holland and Utrecht. The growth in Flevoland was 22 new people per thousand inhabitants. In Noord-Holland it was sixteen per thousand inhabitants and in Zuid-Holland and Utrecht it was thirteen per thousand inhabitants. In Flevoland, the population grew because more people were born than died, because of domestic relocations, and also foreign immigration. In both Noord- and Zuid-Holland, on the other hand, there were more people who moved away from these provinces to other parts of the Netherlands.The difference between Zuid-Holland and Utrecht and the other provinces is not significant. Zeeland was at twelve new people per thousand inhabitants, Gelderland, Overijssel and Groningen at eleven, Limburg, Friesland and Drenthe closed the list with nine new residents per thousand inhabitants.",4 January 2023 - 10:30,Politics

Shortly after the murder, a confidant of the person accused of orchestrating the attack told police that the same group was targeting Rutte, according to a report published Wednesday by Nu.nl. The same witness also linked both plots to Ridouan Taghi, the alleged drug lord wanted by Dutch police for years until his arrest in Dubai at the end of 2019.The witness, nicknamed Eddy, spoke at length with police about Krystian M. The Polish man was 27 years old when he was arrested this past July in the De Vries case. M. was already in jail at the time, awaiting trial in a separate case where he and others allegedly stole cars to be used in assassinations and other violent crimes. That case also has links to Taghi’s family.Eddy reported to police in 2021 with information about the De Vries murder, which took place two months earlier. According to Nu.nl, his witness statement reads that M. had told Eddy about his client in the murder, whom he referred to as “uncle.” Though the man’s name was never revealed, Eddy said that “uncle” was described as the man behind the murder of Nabil B.’s lawyer, Derk Wiersum, and B.’s brother. B. is the key witness in the case against Taghi and his associates regarding multiple assassinations and attempted homicides. De Vries was also assisting B.’s legal team.In his interviews with police, Eddy said that M. also confided in him that the same “uncle” also “wanted to kidnap the prime minister.” Around that same time, Rutte’s security detail was increased substantially. The prime minister reportedly argued at length over the need to visibly step up his protection.This happened after suspicious people were seen observing Rutte’s movements in detail. Authorities referred to them as “spotters.” Spotters were also seen in the vicinity of Peter R. de Vries before he was gunned down in Amsterdam. The spotters observing Rutte had ties to organized crime, Nu.nl reported.It was not immediately clear if “Eddy” is the same person as “Witness 5089.” RTL Nieuws previously reported that the witness came forward out of concern for his and his family’s safety. He also stated that M. referred to his client as his “uncle,” and that M. was “looking for someone who would shoot a journalist” with the contract killing valued at 100,000 euros.A year later, in September 2022, Rutte’s security detail was increased again. The security around Princess Amalia, the oldest daughter of King Willem-Alexander, was also increased to the point she was forced to abandon her plans to attend the University of Amsterdam in-person. She has mostly remained at her parent’s home since then. A month later, Rutte stated that one of his fourth Cabinet’s goals was to “cut off the head of organized crime.”Taghi has not formally been implicated in the murder of Peter R. de Vries. His attorney, Inez Weski, has denied all rumors and allegations linking him to the case. She also said her client was in no way tied to alleged plots targeting Rutte and Princess Amalia.The trial against the first two men arrested in the De Vries case was ordered to start over shortly before a verdict was to be announced. That was due to the arrest of M. and several other suspects, as well as new testimony. A hearing meant to provide an update in that criminal case around the assassination is set for Friday.",4 January 2023 - 09:27,Crime

According to Nu.nl, his witness statement reads that M. had told Eddy about his client in the murder, whom he referred to as “uncle.” Though the man’s name was never revealed, Eddy said that “uncle” was described as the man behind the murder of Nabil B.’s lawyer, Derk Wiersum, and B.’s brother. B. is the key witness in the case against Taghi and his associates regarding multiple assassinations and attempted homicides. De Vries was also assisting B.’s legal team.In his interviews with police, Eddy said that M. also confided in him that the same “uncle” also “wanted to kidnap the prime minister.” Around that same time, Rutte’s security detail was increased substantially. The prime minister reportedly argued at length over the need to visibly step up his protection.This happened after suspicious people were seen observing Rutte’s movements in detail. Authorities referred to them as “spotters.” Spotters were also seen in the vicinity of Peter R. de Vries before he was gunned down in Amsterdam. The spotters observing Rutte had ties to organized crime, Nu.nl reported.It was not immediately clear if “Eddy” is the same person as “Witness 5089.” RTL Nieuws previously reported that the witness came forward out of concern for his and his family’s safety. He also stated that M. referred to his client as his “uncle,” and that M. was “looking for someone who would shoot a journalist” with the contract killing valued at 100,000 euros.A year later, in September 2022, Rutte’s security detail was increased again. The security around Princess Amalia, the oldest daughter of King Willem-Alexander, was also increased to the point she was forced to abandon her plans to attend the University of Amsterdam in-person. She has mostly remained at her parent’s home since then. A month later, Rutte stated that one of his fourth Cabinet’s goals was to “cut off the head of organized crime.”Taghi has not formally been implicated in the murder of Peter R. de Vries. His attorney, Inez Weski, has denied all rumors and allegations linking him to the case. She also said her client was in no way tied to alleged plots targeting Rutte and Princess Amalia.The trial against the first two men arrested in the De Vries case was ordered to start over shortly before a verdict was to be announced. That was due to the arrest of M. and several other suspects, as well as new testimony. A hearing meant to provide an update in that criminal case around the assassination is set for Friday.",4 January 2023 - 09:27,Politics

The group said a collaborative effort led to the stunt, which made use of a laser projector. Police previously said they believed the words were projected from a boat.One of the statements, often referred to as ""14 Words,"" was popularized by American neo-Nazi David Lane, and read, ""We must secure the existence of our people and a future for White children."" Another was ""White Lives Matter,"" a reaction to the Black Lives Matter movement first popularized by an American white supremacist organization. Advocates say the statement attempts to pretend like racism does not exist in society.The OM said that the use of discriminatory hate speech was evident, ""based on the context in which the statements were made, and their coherence."" Prosecutors went on to note the importance of freedom of speech as a fundamental right in the Netherlands. ""But there are limits to that freedom of expression. One of those limits is that expressions may never incite discrimination or offend another segment of the population.""The statements were clearly visible by people on the quay near the bridge attending the national New Year's event organized in Rotterdam.

AgXeed, based in Oirlo in the northern region of Limburg, makes autonomous agricultural vehicles. Amsterdam-based CarbonX developed a more sustainable carbon material for tires. Søvn from Utrecht has made a wearable in-ear device that detects and helps reduce teeth grinding and clenching.There are also software companies that use artificial intelligence, for example, to prevent food waste, such as WasteWatchers and Orbisk from Utrecht and the Enschede company OneThird.

The Helmond-based electric car manufacturer uses solar panels as part of its vehicles. It says it will release news about its first mass model, the Lightyear 2. Lightyear will also be showing the 0, its first, more expensive car that is currently already in production.Automakers in general are increasingly showing up at CES, where the fair previously focused mainly on traditional tech companies such as Microsoft, Samsung and Sony and computer manufacturers such as Acer and Dell. They will still be present, but Volkswagen also posted a message on Instagram to announce its arrival at the fair. That company said it will show a new electric car.

The number of new hospitalizations rose by nearly 60 percent compared to the previous week, the Dutch public health institute said on Tuesday in its regular weekly update on the situation. Figures from the RIVM showed that 63 of patients admitted last week were sent to an intensive care unit, up from 42 the previous week.Out of the 623 admissions, 527 were first taken to the hospital due to the severity of Covid-19 symptoms. The other 96 people were initially admitted for other reasons.Hospitals were treating 819 patients with Covid-19 on Tuesday afternoon, the most at one time since November 8. The patient total has been steadily rising since dipping to a low point of 460 on December 14, according to data from patient coordination service LCPS.During the seven-day period ending on Tuesday, the LCPS said hospitals were admitting an average of 145 new coronavirus patients daily. That reflects a smaller 8 percent increase, though the LCPS reported a more significant increase the week prior. The organization's data is typically different from the RIVM, as their criteria, time period analyzed, and data collection methods are not the same.Despite the overall increase in hospitalizations, the percentage of people reporting symptoms of Covid-19 fell a bit. Some 6.7 percent of people surveyed by the RIVM during the last calendar week of 2022 said they had symptoms of the coronavirus disease, down from 7.3 percent the previous week. More recently, 1.8 percent of surveyed respondents tested positive for the viral infection, up slightly from 1.7 percent. That includes people who self-reported the results of a self-test kit.Officially, 6,245 people tested positive for the coronavirus infection since last Tuesday morning. That was 500 fewer than the previous week, the RIVM said. Those figures only include people who tested positive at a GGD facility or other authorized locations. Just 5,404 coronavirus tests were completed at the GGD during the last calendar week, down from 7,891 the week before.Sewage surveillance did show an increase in coronavirus particles of over 31 percent during the week ending on Christmas Day. That is the continuation of a trend which started over a month ago.The basic reproduction (R) number fell significantly in mid-December, from 1.04 to 0.86. That means that 100 people contagious with the coronavirus on December 20 likely infected 86 others, who then went spread the virus to 74 more people. They then gave the coronavirus to 64 people. When the figure is below 1.00, it indicates a likelihood that fewer people will be infected with the virus on a week-to-week basis.",3 January 2023 - 17:12,Health

The statement, ""White Lives Matter"" was also first popularized by a different American white supremacist group, and is used to try and sweep the existence of racism under the rug, advocates of inclusivity have said.Hoe is het mogelijk dat tijdens de jaarwisseling racistische teksten op de Erasmusbrug in Rotterdam konden worden geprojecteerd? #Rotterdam #racisme #burgemeester pic.twitter.com/lXlWvxNydpThe group said it was planning more campaigns in the near future. ""Our New Year's resolutions are that we hope to see similar cooperation among other groups in our [White] countries,"" though they again used a derivative of the word ""Blank"" instead of white.The Telegram group also released a questionnaire in which suggestions were made for locations for their next statement. Followers can choose from a football stadium, a live concert, at a demonstration, at the Dam Square National Monument, in busy places such as a train station or during another live broadcast.

The police accused the group of younger people in about seventy stabbing incidents in 2022, the highest number in recent years. Ten people died from those incidents in 2022, more than in 2020 and 2021 combined. Youth care workers previously issued warnings about young people more often being found in possession of weapons.Police reported 67 stabbing incidents with teenage suspects last year. The final known case in 2022 took place in Bladel, Noord-Brabant on New Year's Eve where an 18-year-old boy was stabbed to death. A resident of the municipality, also 18, was arrested for the crime, but the motive is still unknown. At the end of October, a 14-year-old boy was stabbed to death at his school in Hoorn in an incident that shocked area residents, which led to the arrest of a 16-year-old boy. Other fatal stabbings in 2022 took place in Middelburg, Amsterdam, Horst, Rosmalen, Breda, Vlaardingen, Vlissingen and Nijmegen.In all of 2021, according to police reports, teenagers were involved in nearly 50 stabbings. Three of these had fatal consequences. A 17-year-old boy was killed in an attack in The Hague. Friends of that victim were said to have stabbed a 14-year-old boy at another location in The Hague shortly before, for which his friends then wanted to take revenge. In Rozenburg, a village in the municipality of Rotterdam, a 17-year-old allegedly stabbed a 21-year-old to death, and in Rijswijk a 26-year-old walking in the park was stabbed to death by a 16-year-old seemingly at random.In 2020, the police reported nearly sixty stabbing incidents carried out by teenagers, which caused four deaths in total. Two fatal stabbings that year happened in Rotterdam, the other two in Alphen aan den Rijn and at the Scheveningen Pier. There were six deaths out of almost sixty cases of knife violence in 2019.

Amsterdam had nine stabbing incidents involving teenage suspects in the past four years. There were six incidents in Breda, Spijkenisse and Goes, and five in Hoofddorp.

In total, the Rotterdam Eye Hospital has so far treated 25 people with serious eye injuries caused by fireworks. The figure rose from 17 earlier on New Year’s Day morning, to 24 by the end of Sunday afternoon.The youngest victim so far is seven years old, and five of the victims are under the age of 17.

It is not yet possible to say how many of the victims will have permanent injuries because of the celebrations at the turn of the new year. They will first have to recover over the coming days.During the New Year’s period bringing in the start of 2020, the hospital treated eighteen patients with eye injuries caused by fireworks.

It was previously known that this person was going to be permanently blind in one eye, but the eye turned out to be so badly damaged that it had to be removed completely, she said.The patient will receive a prosthetic eye. In total, the Rotterdam Eye Hospital has so far treated 25 people with serious eye injuries caused by fireworks. The figure rose from 17 earlier on New Year’s Day morning, to 24 by the end of Sunday afternoon.The youngest victim so far is seven years old, and five of the victims are under the age of 17. Seven people had to undergo surgery. For example, so much gunpowder wound up in their eyes, that debris had to be removed with tweezers, according to the hospital spokesperson. It is not yet possible to say how many of the victims will have permanent injuries because of the celebrations at the turn of the new year. They will first have to recover over the coming days.During the New Year’s period bringing in the start of 2020, the hospital treated eighteen patients with eye injuries caused by fireworks. During the two years after when coronavirus restrictions were in place, the hospital treated far fewer eye patients. On January 1, 2022, the Rotterdam Eye Hospital treated five fireworks victims. None of them underwent surgery at the time.The figure returning to pre-Covid levels prompted means, “We’re back to square one,” said one of the hospital’s ophthalmologists, Tjeerd de Faber, during an interview.

Rotterdam will take the dubious title of murder capital of the Netherlands for 2022. Sixteen people were killed by violence there. The city is followed by Amsterdam, where eleven people were killed.The national figure of 133 was determined by the newspaper using data provided by the regional police districts and website Moordatlas.nl. The website tracks all cases of murder and manslaughter in the Netherlands.The figure is nearly six percent higher than in 2021, when 126 people were killed, according to Statistics Netherlands. The current total is ten percent higher than in 2020, when there were 121 victims of murder or manslaughter.Male victims accounted for at least 80 of the victims, almost double the number of female victims, 41. The preliminary data shows 12 of the victims were below the age of 18. Three of them, two girls and a boy, were babies or toddlers. Seven of the children were boys between 4-17 years of age, while two others were girls in the same age group.With 16 victims, Rotterdam had more murder or manslaughter incidents than any other municipality in the Netherlands. The greater Rotterdam area accounted for 26 victims in total. Rotterdam is the largest city in the province of Zuid-Holland, which also had the highest number of victims, 35, compared to any other province.""This year's statistics are very sad. Every victim is one too many,” said Brigitte Nolden, the head of the Rotterdam police district’s regional detective’s division. “The impact is enormous, because behind every victim are next of kin,"" Nolden told the newspaper.Noord-Holland and Noord-Brabant each had 22 victims, the newspaper reported, followed by Limburg with 16. Gelderland and Zeeland both had eight violent deaths, while Overijssel had six.Preliminary data identified three victims in Flevoland, and two victims each in Drenthe, Friesland and Groningen.Data reviewed by AD last week put the number of victims in the city of Utrecht at zero, with three murder or manslaughter cases in The Hague.

He previously gave the government a score of six, which he said was a generous rating at best. Now, looking back over the entirety of 2022, he said the government rating did not improve, “because they have failed, and they simply do not keep their promises,"" he told the newspaper.He said the government is simply not learning from past mistakes. Because in the southern part of Limburg, for example, the same errors are being repeated with money for flood damage repairs as were made in Groningen with money given out for repairs for earthquake damages.In the upcoming year, he is most concerned that people will still be mistrustful of the government. ""I also understand after all the misery it has caused. They feel as though the government is really sitting opposite of them instead of next to them. It is a bad development,” Van Zutphen said.When asked whether he still has faith in politics, Van Zutphen stated, ""I tend to say no."" He points out that tens of thousands of people have run into major problems because of the government decision making, such as those most affected by the consequences of drilling for natural gas in Groningen, and the victims of the tax office’s child benefits scandal. Thousands of parents were reviewed by an algorithm, which also included racial or ethnic profiling characteristics, and were falsely identified as frauds.They were then cut off from benefits without a fair review, and forced to repay the entirety of the benefits received in the past, placing many into insurmountable debt. The scandal led to the resignation of Prime Minister Mark Rutte’s third Cabinet, however a year after Rutte’s fourth Cabinet took office, many victims have yet to be fully compensated.""In Limburg, citizens are still waiting for their money, a year and a half after the floods. While in a prosperous country like ours you would assume that everything is well organized. And the government knows what needs to be done to solve it,” Van Zutphen said.He also does not feel supported by the Tweede Kamer either. The lower house of Dutch parliament appointed Van Zutphen to the role. He said it was “shocking” that he has to repeat the same story time and time again. “You then experience a lot of sympathy and a listening ear,” he continued, saying it makes him believe work will actually be completed and the situation will be improved.”But if you have to keep singing the same tune a year later because nothing happened...,” said the National Ombudsman. ""Yes, then you sometimes become despondent and you wonder why parliament has actually appointed you and asks you for advice. In any case, there is still little sign of that new administrative culture.""Reporting by ANP and NL Times",2 January 2023 - 09:35,Politics

It was the first time in 17 years that Volkswagen was not the number one brand in the country. The annual analysis of the Dutch passenger vehicle market found that Kia represented 30,036 total vehicle registrations, worth 9.6 percent market share. An estimated 312,129 new passenger cars were registered after purchase in the Netherlands last year, a 3.2 percent decrease compared to the previous year. Volkswagen came in second place, with 25,993 vehicles for 8.3 percent of the market. The German brand delivered about 600 more vehicles than Toyota, which trailed closely behind at 8.1 percent of market share. Peugeot came in fourth place. The 21,242 Peugeot models purchased new in 2022 represented 6.8 percent of the Dutch market, beating out BMW, which held 5.5 percent of the market with 17,138 units purchased.Even though the brand came in fourth, the Peugeot 208 was the most popular new car model, which was registered 9,640 times last year. The Kia Picanto (7,391) and Kia Niro (7,277) came in second and third place, respectively. That was followed by the Volvo XC40 (6,821), and the Opel Corsa (6,669).The report also showed that that share of all-electric models rose to nearly one-fourth of all new car purchases in the country in 2022, according to BOVAG, RAI and RDC. “At 23.5 percent, the share of electric cars out of the total number of registrations was somewhat higher than one year previously,” the organizations wrote in a statement. About 19.8 percent of all new cars sold in 2021 were all-electric models.Despite last year’s drop in deliveries, a total of 340,000 new cars are expected to be registered in the Netherlands in 2023, both BOVAG and RAI. In the report, it was noted that for two years in a row, the automotive industry “was faced with supply problems last year due to global shortages to computer chips and other components.”The auto industry organizations believe manufacturers will catch up on fulfilling orders that were delayed in 2022, leading to a higher number of vehicles registered on Dutch roads. However, there is still uncertainty due to “global and domestic economic and geopolitical developments, not least of which is driven by the war in Ukraine.”Electric cars should continue to be a popular choice with the Dutch government offering consumers 67 million euros in subsidies. The government will provide 2,950 euros for new electric cars purchased with a maximum price of 45,000 euros. Last year, the subsidy ran out about halfway through the year. People who use their company cars for unlimited private use still have to pay a tax for the privilege, however the amount is capped for electric car users.",2 January 2023 - 08:50,Business

365,https://nltimes.nl/2023/01/01/3800-fire-incidents-new-years-significant-church-school-badly-damaged,"Over 3,800 fire incidents during New Year’s; Significant church, school badly damaged","The fire departments in the Netherlands received thousands of reports about incidents across the country on New Year’s Eve and early on New Year’s Day. The incidents include a large fire in a Veghel church that is a historic monument, in a primary school building with a thatched roof, and a daycare center in Amsterdam.The fire service received 3,833 reports of incidents nationwide during the new year’s period the fire brigade reported on the basis of an initial inventory among the 25 security regions in the Netherlands. That number is comparable to the last two New Year’s Eve periods, when fireworks were still banned due to the coronavirus crisis. In the year before the crisis, the number of reports to the fire service were well over 4,000.This year more residential fires were reported than a year earlier: about 134 residential fires compared to 97 last year. On a ""normal day"" there are an average of 19 residential fires, based on the annual figures for 2021. During New Year's Eve 2021 into New Year’s Day 2022 there were almost five times as many. The fire service also received about 724 reports of container fires and 183 of car fires, both numbers slightly less than last year.The very large fire that broke out after midnight in a monumental side building of the Sint-Lambertus Church in Veghel in Noord-Brabant was brought under control, said the Brabant-Noord Security Region. Many firefighters and multiple pieces of equipment rolled out to the scene. Personnel let the fire in the “monumental building to burn out in a controlled manner,” said the security region.“Due to the favorable wind direction, the adjacent church was not in danger,” the security region said on Twitter. The fire was raging in the congregation chapel, a small building that currently serves as a mosque. The security region reported earlier in the night that the annex would probably completely burn down.Ladder trucks and cherry pickers were on the scene to help extinguish the fire from above. The cause of the fire was not immediately known. According to the spokesperson, there were no initial reports that anyone was involved in the fire or was injured. Firefighters also drove tanker trucks around the area looking for fires caused by burning embers spread by the strong wind.The neo-Gothic church, located on the Deken van Miertstraat, was designed by Pierre Cuypers. The extension behind it was also designed by Cuypers. Both buildings are considered national monuments. Cuypers also designed the building that houses the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam, the capital’s central train station, and several other churches in the country.In Utrecht, a fire started on New Year's Eve in the Rietendakschool in the Ondiep district. The fire brigade suspects that fireworks caused the flames in the thatched building built in 1923. The fire was brought under control, reported the Utrecht Security Region.It was a raging fire and ""visible flames"" were extinguished, the service said on Twitter. Specialists in dealing with reeds that catch fire were deployed to keep the fire from re-igniting. The fire damage was limited to the thatched roof, and there was smoke and water damage in the building, the service said. The cause is still under investigation.""We hope that we can save the building,"" a spokesperson said earlier. Because according to him it would be an eternal shame if society lost such a beautiful building, designed in the Amsterdam School architectural style.Fire broke out at the school on four other occasions. None of those incidents took place during the New Year’s period in other years.Several fires broke out in Amsterdam during the turn of the new year. Damage was also caused by fireworks or vandalism. For example, a daycare center on the Markengouw in Amsterdam-Noord suffered major damage due to fireworks. According to the fire service, all windows and facades were completely blown out causing an immense havoc.A fire also raged in a gymnasium of a school on Zuid-Hollandstraat in the Buitenveldert neighborhood. Vandals likely threw a wheelie bin on fire through the window there, according to a spokesperson.Earlier on New Year's Eve, a fire raged in a house at Ubbo Emmiushof in Nieuw-West, which was probably caused by fireworks. Two people suffered smoke inhalation, according to the fire service. They were evaluated by paramedics.The Amsterdam fire brigade was particularly busy with many reports that came in after midnight. Those included container and roadside fires.The mayor of Arnhem, Ahmed Marcouch, tried to carry on a New Year’s tradition started by Herman Kaiser, his predecessor. While Kaiser was mayor from 2013 to 2017, he would eat dinner with firefighters on New Year’s Eve.Marcouch wanted to do the same on Saturday evening, but the firefighters were called out to an emergency. ""The celebration of the New Year is the largest and perhaps the most dangerous event in the Netherlands. And this is only possible because people from the fire brigade, police and ambulance are ready for us to celebrate that party.""In some regions, there were people who threw fireworks at the fire brigade. Police and riot police were needed to help guarantee firefighters’ safety in several parts of the country, including the Haaglanden, Hollands-Midden and Gelderland-Zuid Security Regions. Tijs van Lieshout, the chair of the country’s fire service, said aggression and violence are “never acceptable.” He said first responders should never be the target of verbal or physical abuse “with or without fireworks.”Thousands of firefighters are at the ready every year during New Year's Eve. Van Lieshout emphasized that it is the busiest time of the year for the fire brigade. The firefighters often have to deal with garbage container fires, car fires and outdoor fires. In previous years, most reports came in around midnight.Reporting by ANP and NL Times",1 January 2023 - 15:54,Crime

The Zuid-Holland city displaced nearby The Hague, which had the worst air quality early on January 1, 2022.“In the first hours of 2023, short-term smog caused by particulate matter was measured in many cities in the Netherlands,” said public health institute RIVM. This was caused by fireworks set off to celebrate the new year. “As a result, the air quality was very poor in places for a short time, according to the Dutch Air Quality Index.”The RIVM said that the highest concentration of particulate matter was found in Vlaardingen, where the measurement equaled 850 micrograms per cubic meter of air. In The Hague, the total from from 855 last year to 719 this year. The average was 178 in the first hour of the new year.The high levels of particulate matter can impair lung function, and cause coughing, shortness of breath, or wheezing. It can also exacerbate asthma symptoms, and symptoms from other pulmonary illnesses. The situation was at its worst in the larger municipalities, said RIVM air quality researcher Joost Wesseling in an interview with ANP. “Almost all major cities had high peaks. So there are still many people who had to deal with this poor air quality.""The poor air quality was short lived, the RIVM said. “Due to the high wind speeds, the concentrations quickly dropped to the values ​​before the fireworks.” A representative told the newswire that the air quality at 2:30 a.m. on New Year’s Day was about the same as at 8 p.m. the night before.""If fireworks are set off, or particulate matter is released into the air, then these weather conditions are actually the best,"" said Wesseling.

More than ten officers were injured in The Hague alone.The incidents often involved very powerful fireworks, police said. “The fireworks tradition has become one in which colleagues suffer permanent hearing damage and other injuries every year. I'm angry about that. As a society, we need to think about better ways to ring in the new year,” said Police Chief Henk van Essen in a statement.Police and firefighters were assaulted in at least eight different municipalities. Several different incidents involving the division of the police in The Hague led to more than ten officers being hurt. “Some of them had to be taken to hospital for medical treatment,” police said.Aside from dozens of arrests in the three largest cities of the country, Amsterdam, Rotterdam and The Hague, there were several cases of violence and public disturbance in other municipalities. These were mainly individual incidents, police said. However, there were no “mass public disturbances.” Prosecutors can seek punishments that are three times as severe in cases of assault against first responders and other civil servants during performance of their jobsThe police department said two officers in Helmond were hospitalized after being assaulted with fireworks there, including one with hearing damage. The incident happened when they arrived at the train station there late Saturday afternoon after a group of young people were accused of causing a disturbance there. A police car was also destroyed in the city. At least 11 people were arrested in Helmond and the rest of the eastern portion of Noord-Brabant.One officer addressing a group of young people on Helsingborg in Schiedam was hurt after fireworks were shot at him from a home.

There were no arrests.A 19-year-old was also taken into custody after he was accused of throwing powerful fireworks at firefighters extinguishing a fire. The incident happened at 3:10 a.m. on New Year’s Day.“In Geleen, the police took action against people who were throwing fireworks at a home at around 3:15 a.m. These people then turned on the officers and pelted them with fireworks,” police said.

The images move quite a bit. It is rather sloppy. We don't think this was done by the organization that normally handles the lighting of the bridge. But of course we are investigating that also.""The messages which appeared on the bridge included, “We must secure the existence of our people and a future for White children.” The statement is often referenced as “14 Words,” and was popularized by comments made by neo-Nazi David Lane. He died in prison in the U.S. after convictions related to the murder of Jewish radio host Alan Berg, and conspiracy and racketeering charges linked to the white supremacist organization he helped create.Other statements projected on the bridge included, “Vrolijk Blank 2023 - Happy White 2023,” and “Zwarte Piet deed niets verkeerd,” which translates to “Zwarte Piet did nothing wrong.” The Dutch word “Blank” is often considered by some to be antiquated and discriminatory as it can be used to imply superiority due to an absence of color rather than “white.” The message mentioning Zwarte Piet refers to the traditional winter holiday character often portrayed by white actors in blackface makeup, though support for the tradition has halved in recent years.Alderman Ronald Buijt, who is also the deputy mayor of the city, said to RTL Nieuws, “I found the slogans projected on the bridge tonight to be rude and polarizing. These guys don’t deserve attention even for a second. Rotterdam is one city, a city where everyone is equal.”Additionally, the slogan, “White Lives Matter,” was also projected on the bridge.

Police and riot police units also intervened at several locations in Rotterdam and The Hague, with about three dozen people arrested in Rotterdam alone.A police spokesperson in Amsterdam said on Sunday that no officers were injured overnight. ""But it is very intense when you are pelted with fireworks."" The arrests were made in various places in the city. ""We saw groups of people setting off heavy fireworks at various locations,"" said the spokesperson. Arrests have also been made for public order violations.The police were forced to take action and arrest people during a fight on Dam Square, where many people were gathered in groups. Officers there also confiscated fireworks, the spokesperson said. In Amsterdam there is a prohibition against setting off New Year’s fireworks, but this was almost completely ignored throughout the capital.Three people were injured by a stabbing incident on the Beursplein between Dam Square and Amsterdam’s Central Station. At least one person had to go to the hospital. The exact circumstances were still under investigation, the spokesperson said. There were no arrests as of early on New Year’s Day, she said.The police also had to intervene on Admiraal de Ruijterweg in Amsterdam-West. A number of people were arrested there for throwing fireworks.Due to the bad weather, the organized fireworks shows in Amsterdam did not take place or took place in an adapted format. For example, there was a show at the Museumplein, but it only included light and music with a countdown to the new year. The show with fireworks and drones at the A'DAM Toren will take place on Monday instead of the scheduled New Year’s event.The police in Rotterdam and the surrounding area arrested 35 people in the first hours after midnight on suspicion of involvement in various offenses. According to a spokesperson, the officers were busy, but the general situation was manageable despite many dozens of incidents.Even though there is a fireworks ban in Rotterdam, massive amounts of fireworks were set off in the city.

Police and riot police units also intervened at several locations in Rotterdam and The Hague, with about three dozen people arrested in Rotterdam alone.A police spokesperson in Amsterdam said on Sunday that no officers were injured overnight. ""But it is very intense when you are pelted with fireworks."" The arrests were made in various places in the city. ""We saw groups of people setting off heavy fireworks at various locations,"" said the spokesperson. Arrests have also been made for public order violations.The police were forced to take action and arrest people during a fight on Dam Square, where many people were gathered in groups. Officers there also confiscated fireworks, the spokesperson said. In Amsterdam there is a prohibition against setting off New Year’s fireworks, but this was almost completely ignored throughout the capital.Three people were injured by a stabbing incident on the Beursplein between Dam Square and Amsterdam’s Central Station. At least one person had to go to the hospital. The exact circumstances were still under investigation, the spokesperson said. There were no arrests as of early on New Year’s Day, she said.The police also had to intervene on Admiraal de Ruijterweg in Amsterdam-West. A number of people were arrested there for throwing fireworks.Due to the bad weather, the organized fireworks shows in Amsterdam did not take place or took place in an adapted format. For example, there was a show at the Museumplein, but it only included light and music with a countdown to the new year. The show with fireworks and drones at the A'DAM Toren will take place on Monday instead of the scheduled New Year’s event.The police in Rotterdam and the surrounding area arrested 35 people in the first hours after midnight on suspicion of involvement in various offenses. According to a spokesperson, the officers were busy, but the general situation was manageable despite many dozens of incidents.Even though there is a fireworks ban in Rotterdam, massive amounts of fireworks were set off in the city. The police and street enforcement teams largely did not intervene when observing people setting off fireworks.Police officers did have to take action in various places, including in the Crooswijk district where the riot police had to break up a large group of young people because they set off extremely powerful fireworks and ignored police instructions to leave.

377,https://nltimes.nl/2023/01/01/17-fireworks-victims-treated-eye-injuries-specialist-hospital,17 fireworks victims being treated for eye injuries at specialist hospital,"Seventeen victims with eye injuries caused by fireworks were brought to the Rotterdam Eye Hospital during the turn of the year. That number will likely increase during the day, said ophthalmologist Tjeerd de Faber. Additionally, four others were treated at Rotterdam Maasstad Hospital for burns on their faces caused by fireworks explosions.Six people have already undergone surgery. De Faber called it an ""old-fashioned horrific night.”Most fireworks victims were hit by decorative fireworks, according to the ophthalmologist. This involved both people who set off the fireworks themselves and bystanders who were watching. ""People think that decorative fireworks are safer, but that is not the case. The wind in particular played a role last night,” which caused the fireworks to either drift in the air, or shoot off in unexpected directions. “One of the patients was hit when he was 25 meters away,"" explained De Faber.One of the victims is permanently blind in one eye, and six others have permanent injuries. It is still unclear how serious the damage is for the rest, reported De Faber. The number of patients may increase, especially because other hospitals refer patients to the Rotterdam facility.Three years ago during the last turn of the new year before coronavirus restrictions hampered celebrations, the hospital treated eighteen patients with eye injuries caused by fireworks. During the coronavirus years, far fewer eye patients required treatment. On January 1, 2022, the Rotterdam Eye Hospital treated five fireworks victims. None of them required surgery at the time.""We are back to square one. It's a shame that this has to be the price of celebrating New Year's again,"" said De Faber. He has been arguing for years for a permanent nationwide ban on fireworks to prevent eye injuries caused by the explosives.Of the four victims treated at the Rotterdam Maasstad Hospital, one was discharged by 4:30 a.m. on New Year’s Day. Two victims were still in the regular care wards at the facility, and one was in intensive care.The fireworks injuries included burns to hands, face and legs. A spokesperson for the hospital could not reveal the victims’ ages. It was also ""very busy"" in the emergency room, but not abnormally so, she said. The emergency department treated a total of six fireworks victims, four of whom were referred to the burn center.The burn center is one of three national burn centers in the country. The other two are in Beverwijk and Groningen. At the beginning of November, the burn centers in the Netherlands reported there had already been a few dozen child victims of fireworks accidents that involved fireworks meant for use by children, such as fountains and ground bloom flowers, the Dutch Burns Foundation reported.Third-degree burns had occurred in some cases, and surgery was a necessity for several children. ""If victims continue to be added at this rate, we can call it a serious problem,"" said pediatric and burns surgeon Annebeth de Vries of the Red Cross Hospital in Beverwijk at the time.",1 January 2023 - 09:29,One-one-two
379,https://nltimes.nl/2022/12/31/niesters-illusion-think-can-stop-coronavirus,Niesters: Illusion to think you can stop coronavirus,"Whether it is right for the government to offer travelers from China only a voluntary self-test for the coronavirus, virologist Bert Niesters does not know. ""The virus is coming here, we can't stop it, we don't need to have any illusions about that. But Europe now has a mess of rules, and that's a shame. It makes more sense to have a European approach,"" Niesters argued.Other countries require the presentation of a negative Covid-19 test or vaccination certificate before leaving China. This regulation is in place in the United Kingdom, France, Spain and Italy. Also other countries have taken measures, such as the United States, South Korea, Malaysia, Taiwan, Japan and India. Belgium will discuss the situation next week.The Netherlands however, sticks with the self-test offered and the recommendation to go into isolation in case of a positive result. But Niesters does not know what the right approach is. ""I don't have to do politics. I am already glad that the minister is now speaking out, so that something is being said after all. Because the ministry and RIVM were the only ones you didn't hear from last week.""The Dutch are generally well protected against the coronavirus, according to the virologist. People have built up a high level of protection through vaccination and through one or more infections with Covid-19. ""That helps against serious illness, but it doesn't prevent you from getting infected. And even if it's the omicron variety, you can get reasonably sick from it. We're not worried that there will be a dangerous variant, but who can predict the future?""For Niesters, the big problem is in the numbers. ""The wave in China is huge. Assuming half of the Chinese are infected, we're talking about 700 million people. That's more cases than have been detected worldwide so far. That's not a small peak.""The virologist explained that he is sometimes shocked at the number of people infected on flights from China. In Milan recently, about half of all passengers on some flights from China tested positive. ""If half are (tested) positive, everyone is infected, you can assume that. Because then you can't escape it if you're on a plane with others for 12 hours. But the chance that you won't get infected then is very small.""
That is why, according to Niesters, it is important for China to continue testing for the coronavirus and analyzing test samples to determine which variants are circulating. These so-called sequences should then also be shared by the country with the rest of the world. ""Groningen has also shared more results in recent months. The World Health Organization has asked China to provide more up-to-date information so we can make risk assessments and take effective action.""",31 December 2022 - 17:10,Health

She warned that New Year's Eve is no exception and that attacks on police officers, firefighters and paramedics could be punished more strictly.Yeşilgöz paid a working visit to the fire department and police in Almere on Saturday. In recent years, rescue workers were regularly attacked during the turn of the year. According to the Justice Minister, there will be transgressions again this year.""There is no excuse for this. The moment you attack an emergency worker who is there for your safety, freedom and health, you should be punished really severely,"" Yeşilgöz told Dutch newspaper Omroep Flevoland. ""Don't harass social workers. Otherwise, you have to face consequences for the rest of your life, because you can also be punished very strictly,"" the minister emphasized. This is the first time in two years that fireworks have been allowed to be set off again. They were banned in the last two New Year's Eve years because of the pandemic. This resulted in fewer arrests and incidents compared to previous years.

The German Joseph Aloisius Ratzinger, as he was known by his real name, turned 95.""With the passing of Pope Emeritus Benedict XVI, the Roman Catholic Church and all Catholics worldwide lose an important spiritual and intellectual leader. We remember him with respect,"" the Prime Minister tweeted.Met het overlijden van Paus emeritus Benedictus XVI verliezen de Rooms-Katholieke Kerk en alle katholieken wereldwijd een belangrijk spiritueel en intellectueel leider. We herdenken hem met respect.According to Minister and CDA chairman Wopke Hoekstra (Foreign Affairs), Benedict XVI was committed to promoting peace and strengthening understanding between people of different races, nations and religious backgrounds.Saddened by the passing of former Pope Benedict XVI. He worked hard to promote peace and foster understanding between people of different races, nations and religious backgrounds. My sincere condolences to Catholics around the world and to all who hold him in their hearts.The Dutch bishops are asking to pray for the peace of mind of dead Pope Emeritus Benedict XVI. The call was made by Bishop Hans van den Hende of the Diocese of Rotterdam, chairman of the Dutch Bishops' Conference.According to Van den Hende, love for the Pope Emeritus was the common thread in the social teaching of the Catholic Church. In 2009, he also wrote an encyclical about it titled Caritas in Veritate (Love in Truth). ""For Benedict, faith found its completion in the love of Christ. For him, faith and love belonged together. We can transmit this love from our encounter with Christ,"" Bishop Van den Hende said.In response to the death of the former head of the Catholic Church, Cardinal Wim Eijk said that “Benedict XIV was a true man of God and a pope after Jesus' heart. He was extremely lovable and undeservedly misunderstood by many.” Eijk met Pope Benedict personally and quite frequently when Joseph Ratzinger himself was still a cardinal and prefect of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith. Nevertheless, the years in which Pope Emeritus Benedict XVI led the Roman Catholic Church have been overshadowed by scandals over the sexual abuse of minors by clergy. Before he was elected pope in April 2005, numerous scandals had already emerged in the United States, followed by other countries such as Belgium, the Netherlands and his native country Germany.He was accused of not doing enough about the abuse, even though he spoke to victims in the United States, among other countries, and condemned the abuse on several occasions. Furthermore, Benedict XVI also allegedly covered up clerical misconduct as prefect of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith (1981-2005) and before that as archbishop of Munich.",31 December 2022 - 14:50,Culture

The wind is expected to be blowing too hard on New Year's Eve, and thus the wood pallets will go up in flames starting at 11 p.m. on Friday evening.The municipality of The Hague has announced that wind force 6 or 7 is expected on the beach on New Year's Eve. That is equivalent to wind speeds of about 40 to 60 kilometers per hour. ""That poses too great a risk for local residents, spectators and buildings."" The mayor of The Hague, Jan van Zanen, called it a downer that the bonfires cannot be lit at the turn of the year itself. ""But we have agreed that the fire will only be lit if it is safe to do so. Safety comes first.""Due to the bad weather forecast, the fireworks show and the New Year's party around the Hofvijver will not take place on Saturday evening. The smaller bonfires in the Laak and Escamp districts cannot be lit either. Construction of those was set to begin on Saturday.Wooden pallets have been piled up on the beaches of Scheveningen and Duindorp in recent days. These stacks may be a maximum of 10 meters high, 10 meters long and 10 meters wide.The bonfires were a tradition in Scheveningen and Duindorp for many years. Young people from the neighborhoods worked for days to build the highest pile of wood. The situation went awry during the turn of the year from 2018 to 2019. The strong wind then blew smoldering wood across Scheveningen. The shower of burning embers caused more than a million euros in damage there.It then turned out that the two piles of wood on the beach were much higher than had been agreed with the municipality. The towers were allowed to be 35 meters high, but the Duindorp stack was almost 49 meters high and the one in Scheveningen was over 45 meters. The municipality did not do enough to enforce the rules. The investigation led to the resignation of Mayor Pauline Krikke.Due to the shower of embers, the bonfires were not allowed on the following New Year's Eve. After that, the bonfires were not allowed to be built up due to restrictions related to the coronavirus. This year, Scheveningen and Duindorp received permission to build up the piles of wood for the first time in four years.",30 December 2022 - 17:19,One-one-two

A person of color who grew up in poverty, Pelé developed into a world star. The Dutch football association KNVB also commemorated the death of the Brazilian football great Pelé on Thursday. ""A football icon"", is how the KNVB described Pelé, who died at the age of 82. ""Rest in Peace, Pelé.""A football icon.Rest in peace, Pelé. 🤍 pic.twitter.com/hFbQ3rjtaJ""Gratitude for your legacy,"" Seedorf wrote. He himself ended his own football career in Brazil at the beginning of 2014 with Rio de Janeiro's Botafogo club. Pelé played almost his entire career for Santos in São Paulo.Pelé influence ""can’t be measured simply by his 3 World Cup victories. ""The love of the people on the world for the game, the globalisation of the game and your social impact globally, the racial awareness that opened the doors for black players and of course your magic with the ball and so much more,"" Seedorf continued. ""It has been a long and amazing journey. You have taught us so many lessons.""Pelé not only gave Brazil its first world title in 1958, followed by two more World Cups in 1962 and 1970, but also became a figurehead for the Black population with a similar background in the South American country. Nicknamed ""O Rei,"" which translates as The King, he was criticized for rarely using his status to draw attention to racism or political issues.After his career as a football ambassador, Pelé devoted himself to social projects by the United Nations and Unicef, among others. Last summer, he called on Russian President Vladimir Putin in an open letter to end the war in Ukraine.Sad day for the world of football. Rest in peace, Pelé 🤍 pic.twitter.com/uVe6frAHO1""Until your last moment it was all positivity and love towards the people you connected with and the whole world,"" said 46-year-old Seedorf, who won the Champions League a total of four times with Ajax, Real Madrid and AC Milan. ""You shall always be remembered as the king of football and most importantly you will be remembered for the great human being you have been during your time on this earth.""Aside from the KNVB's message, other Dutch football organizations made their feelings known.Ajax published a photo on Twitter of Pelé in an embrace with Johan Cruijff, who died in 2016. ""A sad day for football. Rest in peace, Pelé,"" said the Amsterdam club.PSV shared a message from Pelé's account announcing his death with two emoji, the Brazilian flag, and two hands folded together in prayer.

According to ABN AMRO, the bank behind the service for mobile payments, 130 million payments were sent using Tikkie valued at a combined total of 5.5 billion euros.With that, 2022 leaves the previous record from last year far behind. People then paid 4.2 billion euros via over 100 million tikkies. A Tikkie is often sent to settle expenses between a group of people, such as for dinners or drinks, so the hospitality industry restrictions during much of 2021 in response to the coronavirus pandemic likely explains some of the difference. “I think that will be a part of it. It is true that Tikkies are usually food or drink related,” said Moreno Kensmil, head of marketing for Tikkie, about the difference from last year. During coronavirus lockdowns, there was a dip seen in the number of mobile payments being sent, although the decrease was limited, he claimed. “But this year we saw more payments were being made with the opening of the catering industry, and also Carnival and festivals that were allowed again.”Alongside the end of the coronavirus crisis, Kensmil added that more and more users are joining the payment service. Also, the average payment was higher this year by several euros. The highest number of Tikkies sent in a single day happened on Friday, November 25. Almost 530,000 Tikkies were paid that day, where about 350,000 are sent on an average day. That day the Netherlands men’s football team played against Ecuador at the FIFA World Cup. It was also Black Friday, a day which originated in the United States but has taken a place in Dutch consumerism, with shops giving discounts before the holiday season. It is mainly residents that use Tikkie for sending payment request, yet more companies are using the service. Compared to last year, the number of business users rose by a quarter to 25,000, which led to introduction of a business version of the service. The speed at which people pay is a possible benefit.

She has previously said she is innocent.De K. is still considered the primary suspect in the case.According to Dean's mother, the Dutch woman lied to her at the time when the mother asked about the whereabouts of her son.

The newspaper cited conclusions from an internal investigation to report that Kaouthar Darmoni was dismissed as the head of Atria. The institute states on its website that it promotes “gender equality and women’s history” that also “examines the current position of women in society and provides advice for future policy.”Darmoni was accused of “transgressive and intimidating behavior” that was sometimes sexual in nature, and targeted her subordinates. The internal investigation also found that she deleted criticism from a staff survey to conceal results from the supervisory board, and made false statements regarding her education and work experience.Darmoni said her termination was unjustified, and based on “a collection of fabrications.” She plans to file a lawsuit challenging her dismissal, the newspaper said.Darmoni took over as director of the organization in October 2019. Many of the accusations current and former Atria staff members made against her date back to 2020. The investigation was launched in July 2022 by Hoffmann Bedrifsrecherche, an external firm organizations can hire to study their internal workings. The director was described by former employees as an “uninhibited” exhibitionist who on occasion would strip down to “her bra or her thong” in the open office space, the Volkskrant reported. They detailed how Darmoni allegedly kissed people without permission on their heads, or would grind against them during mandatory dance sessions.They described that she started weekly meetings by forcing workers to participate in belly dancing. “Most of us thought that was terrible. Sometimes Kaouthar pressed her breasts or buttocks against you while dancing. If someone said something about her behavior, she would laugh at you squarely,” said one worker who went by the name of Nicky.Anyone who complained about Darmoni’s antics would be bullied or ridiculed, the investigation found. “If you fell out of favor with Kaouthar, you ended up before the tribunal,"" said one worker identified by the name of Charlie. “She would turn other colleagues against you or start yelling at you in front of everyone. We had a constant fear: ‘Who is going to be next?’”To enforce the hostile work environment, another employee claimed Darmoni placed security cameras that could record both video and audio around the institute’s office in Amsterdam Centrum. The cameras were not necessarily used for their stated purpose of preventing theft or vandalism. An employee named Sam claimed that workers were often asked to account for issues recorded by the cameras. “This was repeatedly reported because it violates privacy laws. But nothing was ever done about it,” Sam told Volkskrant.In another instance, the investigation into Darmoni found that she deleted statements pleading for help by about half of Atria’s workers who participated in an employee survey. These messages were not reviewed by the organization’s supervisory board as a result. Mistruths about her background, including statements about her education and prior work experience, were the result of “deceit and/or error,” according to the final report on the investigation, Volkskrant reported.Darmoni would not comment about the claims former workers made in conversations with the newspaper. She also said she has not read the final report about the internal investigation, but she did review the questions asked by investigators, which she said were meant to lead people to paint the wrong picture about her. “The opinion of employees who are positive and have objected to the insinuating question posed by the researchers has not been included.”The newspaper did note that in a previous interview with the Volkskrant’s weekly magazine supplement, Darmoni said, “Even before the pandemic broke out, I was sometimes warned: be careful with touching, it is transgressive behavior. Some women at Atria found it a bit scary at first, but then they loved it.”Atria’s supervisory board would not respond substantively to questions from the newspaper about the investigation, calling it an ongoing legal matter that involved mediation between Atria and its former director. An in email to current and former staff obtained by the Volkskrant, they wrote that they regretted the “unsafe work situation” went unaddressed for as long as it did. “Although the Supervisory Board was also fooled by Ms. Darmoni for many months and even from the outset, the Supervisory Board regrets that the supervisory system did not function properly on several occasions.”The statement was not enough for the former workers who spoke to the newspaper, who said the organization is trying to prevent as much publicity about the issue as possible. “I understand that the Supervisory Board wants to safeguard Atria's reputation and the subsidy from [the Ministry of Education, Culture and Science]. That is also important, because many people are doing good work there. But if you keep Kaouthar's misbehavior quiet, she will soon be in a high position somewhere else and making victims there too.”",30 December 2022 - 09:23,Politics

If someone said something about her behavior, she would laugh at you squarely,” said one worker who went by the name of Nicky.Anyone who complained about Darmoni’s antics would be bullied or ridiculed, the investigation found. “If you fell out of favor with Kaouthar, you ended up before the tribunal,"" said one worker identified by the name of Charlie. “She would turn other colleagues against you or start yelling at you in front of everyone. We had a constant fear: ‘Who is going to be next?’”To enforce the hostile work environment, another employee claimed Darmoni placed security cameras that could record both video and audio around the institute’s office in Amsterdam Centrum. The cameras were not necessarily used for their stated purpose of preventing theft or vandalism. An employee named Sam claimed that workers were often asked to account for issues recorded by the cameras. “This was repeatedly reported because it violates privacy laws. But nothing was ever done about it,” Sam told Volkskrant.In another instance, the investigation into Darmoni found that she deleted statements pleading for help by about half of Atria’s workers who participated in an employee survey. These messages were not reviewed by the organization’s supervisory board as a result. Mistruths about her background, including statements about her education and prior work experience, were the result of “deceit and/or error,” according to the final report on the investigation, Volkskrant reported.Darmoni would not comment about the claims former workers made in conversations with the newspaper. She also said she has not read the final report about the internal investigation, but she did review the questions asked by investigators, which she said were meant to lead people to paint the wrong picture about her. “The opinion of employees who are positive and have objected to the insinuating question posed by the researchers has not been included.”The newspaper did note that in a previous interview with the Volkskrant’s weekly magazine supplement, Darmoni said, “Even before the pandemic broke out, I was sometimes warned: be careful with touching, it is transgressive behavior. Some women at Atria found it a bit scary at first, but then they loved it.”Atria’s supervisory board would not respond substantively to questions from the newspaper about the investigation, calling it an ongoing legal matter that involved mediation between Atria and its former director. An in email to current and former staff obtained by the Volkskrant, they wrote that they regretted the “unsafe work situation” went unaddressed for as long as it did. “Although the Supervisory Board was also fooled by Ms. Darmoni for many months and even from the outset, the Supervisory Board regrets that the supervisory system did not function properly on several occasions.”The statement was not enough for the former workers who spoke to the newspaper, who said the organization is trying to prevent as much publicity about the issue as possible. “I understand that the Supervisory Board wants to safeguard Atria's reputation and the subsidy from [the Ministry of Education, Culture and Science]. That is also important, because many people are doing good work there. But if you keep Kaouthar's misbehavior quiet, she will soon be in a high position somewhere else and making victims there too.”",30 December 2022 - 09:23,Business
444,https://nltimes.nl/2022/12/30/four-times-many-young-people-arrested-weapons-2019,Four times as many young people arrested with weapons as in 2019,"The police arrested 1,268 young people up to the age of 18 this year for illegal possession of weapons, a sharp increase compared to four years ago, according to the police. In 2019, there were 315 minors arrested for similar crimes. The police are concerned about the fact that more and more young people are being arrested for the illegal possession of weapons.The number of knives and other stabbing weapons seized rose from 33 to 355 in the past four years. In 2019, the police confiscated 27 firearms from young people, a figure which soared to 144. The police said that it is difficult to identify the actual number of firearms young people possess based on these figures.Possession of prohibited fireworks is also included in the overall figure. In 2022, more than 50 percent of the illegal possession of weapons among young people involved fireworks. That share is decreasing: in 2019 the rate was still 74 percent.Martin Sitalsing called the figures “worrying.” He is the police leader responsible for how the department handles issues related to care and security. Sitalsing said the numbers are “unfortunately not surprising. Police officers on the street experience daily that young people find it increasingly normal to carry a weapon.” On average, the police arrest three to four minors a day who have a weapon with them.The police cited the increase in threats of violence on social media and the glorification of weapons ownership and violence in drill-rap music as two of the reasons for the increase in gun ownership. The police themselves are also searching social media more often for signs of weapons possession. ""This increased attention can also be an explanation for the increase,"" said Sitalsing.“Carrying weapons should never be considered normal,” said Sitalsing. ""If you have a weapon in your pocket, you are more likely to actually use it. With all the risks of serious injury or even death."" Last November, for example, a 14-year-old boy in Hoorn died from a stabbing incident at his school, for which a 16-year-old suspect was arrested.The police are trying to prevent young people from owning weapons by checking more people for them, sometimes as a “preventive search,” Sitalsing said. The police and municipalities also organize weapon surrender campaigns, where people can hand in their weapons anonymously and with impunity.",30 December 2022 - 08:28,Crime

According to the hospital, it was the first time in the Netherlands these two organs were transplanted during the same procedure.The woman is doing well, said the UMCG, and has started her recovery. The patient had a severe heart defect from birth, and was missing the right side of her heart. Her heart has already been operated on several times, but the deficiency has also affected her liver.That can lead to an accumulation of moisture and shortness of breath in cases like hers and, in nearly all cases, to the person's death when they are between the age of 30 and 40. In the Netherlands, there are around a few hundred people with this condition, according to the UMCG.A double transplant is better than when a patient gets a new heart first and then a new liver, explained a spokesperson from the UMCG. If somebody were to receive a new heart, they must take medication for the rest of their life to ensure that their body does not reject the transplanted organ.Then, if the patient requires a liver sometime later, it is hard to find one that will fit precisely with the medication the patient is already taking from the first transplant. Placing a new liver as a preventative measure before the heart transplant is necessary is also not possible as there are not enough donors available. Only people who specifically need the new organ are considered for a transplant. The operation took nearly 24 hours, with seventeen medical specialists and over thirty assistants working on the patient. Preparations started years ago for the procedure. The operation was very complicated, according to one of the surgeons. The patient's heart was defective, but so was the way in which the organ was positioned in the body. This made it difficult to attach the transplanted heart properly. The patient was said to have been given ""a second life"" due to the organ. Combination transplantations are not infrequent in the transplantation center in Groningen, such as heart and lung transplants. The spokesperson for the hospital would not say when the latest surgery was carried out. This is to protect the privacy of the patient, donor, and donor's relatives, as it makes it more difficult for them to track each other down.",30 December 2022 - 07:30,Health

Several hospitals were contacted by ANP, with representatives explaining the situation there.There was a nationwide fireworks ban during the last two New Year's periods. Hospitals were very busy with coronavirus patients at that time, and the ban was supposed to help prevent an overload of patients. This year will be the first time since the 2019-2020 turn of the new year that fireworks are allowed to be bought and sold. Officially people are only allowed to buy them from Thursday, and only allowed to set them off between 6 p.m. on December 31 and 2 a.m. on January 1. In practice, that time frame is difficult to enforce.The burn victim center in Beverwijk has treated eleven people in the last few days, all children that were wounded by fireworks. ""The amount is no different from the last few years.""The OLVG in Amsterdam has treated three fireworks victims in the last few days. According to the hospital, New Year's parties and alcohol usage lead to more wounded than the fireworks, and more urgent care visits. In the last New Year's, the hospitality industry had to deal with restrictions. That led to a more significant reduction than the firework ban, according to the OLVG. ""It's just that the firework injuries lead to heavier and longer damage.""At the Haaglanden Medical Center in the Hague, the number of people with fireworks injuries is ""less than a handful; we see no difference compared to the last few years.""The Haga hospital in the Hague has seen no new fireworks patients in the last few days. The Groene Hart hospital in Gouda said, ""It is very quiet in our case when it comes to firework wounds; we see no difference with the last few years."" Similar reports came from the Alrijne hospital in Leiden, and the Canisius Wilhelmina hospital.A spokesperson there said they have ""actually hardly seen people with wounds from fireworks, no serious cases in any case. This is about comparable with the last couple of years.""Many hospitals have not seen a fireworks victim to date.

This includes the Jeroen Bosch Ziekenhuis (Den Bosch), Amphia (Breda), Bernhoven (Uden), Streekziekenhuis Koningin Beatrix (Winterswijk), Martini (Groningen), Gelre (Apeldoorn and Zutphen), Albert Schweitzer (Dordrecht) and the Ikazia (Rotterdam),",29 December 2022 - 19:40,Health

Ahead of the appeal that will be argued in court in January, the Cabinet asked the Council of State for an injunction against several recent court rulings. Those prevented the Cabinet in specific cases from extending the amount of time it could take to issue visas to family members of recognized refugees who want to travel to the Netherlands. The Council of State denied the Cabinet's request on Thursday.""In both cases, the preliminary relief judge found the interest of the family members who will travel in connection with family reunification outweighs the interest"" of the state secretary who does not want to implement the court rulings, the Council of State said on Thursday. The rulings by the preliminary relief judge mean that the family members of two Turkish refugee status holders can immediately obtain permission to enter the Netherlands for family reunification.In recent weeks, several courts have struck down the Cabinet's travel restriction, partly because it conflicts with many national agreements and international treaties. State Secretary Eric van der Burg for asylum policy appealed against those rulings, and applied to the Council of State for a preliminary injunction that would halt implementation of the rulings from the courts of Amsterdam and Middelburg. This would have suspended the lower courts' decisions until a ruling is issued on appeal.However, the requests from the state secretary were rejected on the basis of a weighing of interests, the Council of State said. Van der Burg said in a response, ""We have taken note of the ruling and the IND will follow up on this."" The IND is the Dutch immigration office.Several courts have all ruled that the government's restriction on travel in connection with family reunification is illegal and that the family members of the refugee status holders who had gone to court for this must be allowed to come to the Netherlands.At the end of August, the Cabinet decided to impose a restriction on travel in connection with family reunification. This applied to family members of recognized refugees. A visa may be issued after approval no more than fifteen months following submission of the application for family reunification.If the refugee status holder acquires a home for his or her relatives traveling to the Netherlands, the visa can be issued earlier. The measure applies up to and including 2023 and, according to the Cabinet, is necessary to relieve the pressure on the overburdened asylum reception system.In January, the Council of State will hear the Cabinet's appeal.

Currently, travelers from China have to complete a coronavirus test on arrival in Italy, but the Dutch Ministry of Health has said it does not intend to implement new restrictions at this time. The amount of people infected with coronavirus is rising rapidly in China, especially since the government has lifted nearly all restrictions. According to Osterhaus, it is to be expected that this wave will partly find its way to Europe. It is also easier for new variants to arise when the virus is circulating so strongly.But Osterhaus is not expecting big problems for Europe. ""We are in the tail-end of the pandemic. We have built up a suitable herd immunity."" That means that many people are better protected against the virus due to vaccination or because they have already been infected. If a new variant were to pop up, we could expect more coronavirus cases, but the virologist points out that this also happens regularly with the flu. ""And we don't implement these kinds of measures with that either."" Despite this, the measures against passengers traveling from China should be taken under consideration, he said. A negative test for people who arrive on a plane from that country is the most logical option, Osterhaus thinks.""We have plenty of experience with that."" A test on arrival is trickier, ""because what do you do if 10 percent of the flight tests positive?"" Most important is that any new rules apply to all of Europe because somebody wanting to travel to Italy from China could, in theory, travel to a different European country first, and then cross the border without a test. Good agreements about the conditions are also important, like the maximum period of validity for a negative test. But if measures are to be taken, it has to happen now.""You should not hold meetings about this for the next three weeks.""",29 December 2022 - 13:50,Health

""People are often a bit apprehensive about discussing such things with young children. But I know from experience and research that kids find history super interesting, as long as you use language they understand,"" she told De Telegraaf.The debate on how to deal with the Netherlands' colonial past was evident in Prime Minister Mark Rutte's recent speech in which he apologized on behalf of the Dutch state for its involvement in slavery. In the speech, Rutte announced that the Netherlands will take responsibility for its colonial past and the Dutch government will establish a fund of 200 million euros to invest in social initiatives, to help people to process the impact of the slave trade, and to commemorate those enslaved and their descendants.The money will also be used to create more awareness and involvement. For example, the money may be used to pay for a research program to gain more insight into the impact of the history of slavery, and discrimination as well as racism should be given a permanent place in education in the Netherlands.Although many families wonder how best to deal with this sensitive topic so that children can properly absorb and understand it, there are several ways to do so, De Groot-Reuvekamp said. Parents can teach their children about slavery and the Dutch colonial past in an age-appropriate way through books and by visiting cultural institutions such as museums. Several Dutch museums offer education about the slavery past. For example, the Tropenmuseum in Amsterdam, which has exhibitions on Suriname and at the same time educates visitors about how the people of Suriname dealt with slavery, and the lasting consequences were for the population.

471,https://nltimes.nl/2022/12/29/fireworks-sales-start-today-2-years-covid-restrictions-german-market-popular,Fireworks sales start today after 2 years of Covid restrictions; German market popular,"For the first time in three years, consumers in the Netherlands can again legally buy fireworks starting on Thursday. The sale of fireworks on the Dutch market was banned the past two years due to restrictions during the coronavirus pandemic. The legal selling period lasts for three days, expiring on New Year’s Eve. The webshops where fireworks could be ordered in advance have been open since mid-November.A minimum age of 16 applies for the purchase or collection of fireworks categorized as F2. Households are also forbidden from having more than 25 kilograms of fireworks. The current restrictions only allow the sale of decorative fireworks, because since 2020 there has been a ban on explosive firecrackers that only produce a loud sound and possibly a flash. Fireworks sellers are also required to provide customers with free safety goggles and lighter fuses with their order.Fireworks may legally be detonated starting at 6 p.m. on December 31. The period ends on January 1 at 2 a.m. At least ten municipalities have put a ban on detonating fireworks, including during the New Year's Eve period. Fireworks may not be set off in Amsterdam, Rotterdam, Schiedam, Nijmegen and Apeldoorn, among others.The fireworks industry expects about 85 million euros in legal fireworks to be sold. That is an increase of over 10 percent more compared to 77 million euros in sales in 2019. Fireworks sellers have already seen the number of pre-sale orders rise sharply. The volume of pre-sale orders placed were between one-and-a-half to two times higher compared to the same period in 2019, according to SVNC, the association of Dutch consumer grade fireworks sellers.The pre-sales were also high across the border in Germany, where Dutch interest seems to be high again this year, possibly even bigger than before the coronavirus crisis, said VuurwerkDuitsland, a company with several locations on the German side of the border. Heron Fireworks in Emmerich also noted that a strikingly high number of fireworks packages have been ordered in advance from the Netherlands. Just like in the Netherlands, firework purchases in Germany can be collected from Thursday, and retailers can sell fireworks directly to consumers.German fireworks are generally cheaper and, according to experts, prettier than fireworks sold in the Netherlands. In addition, all types of fireworks are still for sale in Germany, from joke and prank fireworks such as snap pops, to very expensive, large flares and heavy explosive firecrackers. In the Netherlands, fireworks sellers must comply with strict rules, but in Germany, fireworks may be sold anywhere, for example in supermarkets. The road from the border near Nijmegen to a shopping center with many supermarkets and fireworks sellers in Kranenburg, Germany, carries the nickname Feuerwerk-Allee, or Firework Alley, during the last days of the year.Dutch consumers who buy fireworks in Germany can take a maximum of 25 kilograms across the border. At most points of sale, a buyer must be at least 18 years old, but 16-year-olds can already purchase items at some supermarkets. Having fireworks orders delivered to the home is prohibited. The firecrackers from Germany must also be provided with a Dutch-language manual. From Thursday to Saturday, the Marechaussee and police will more heavily patrol the border region to monitor the situation. Traffic controllers are often also needed to manage the miles-long traffic jams from the border to German fireworks shops and back.Checking all fireworks buyers is impossible, according to a police spokesperson. ""But anyone who crosses the border with a large, full trailer runs the risk of being pulled over. This can result in a fine of at least 100 euros and a mark on the criminal record.""",29 December 2022 - 10:30,Business

The Cabinet member in charge of asylum policy said the Dutch immigration service (IND) can process asylum applications from Russian people and reject them.These Russians no longer have to fear being called up for military operations, the Ministry of Justice and Security stated. This is because the ""Russian Defense Minister has announced that the mobilization has been completed, and instructed the military units to halt mobilization work as of October 31,"" the ministry wrote.Additionally, decisions on asylum applications submitted by Russians conscripts who refuse to serve have been halted for the upcoming half-year. The same was true for Russian conscripts who deserted the military.They may remain in the Netherlands for the time being. This moratorium on asylum decisions and deportation for Russian conscripts was extended by six months by the state secretary on Wednesday.The ministry said it still needed more reliable information about ""to what extent conscripts in Russia were (forcefully) deployed in the war in Ukraine,"" the ministry wrote. Therefore, ""it is not yet possible to carefully decide on the asylum applications of Russian conscripts from 18 to 27 years old.""The moratorium does not apply to professional Russian soldiers who then chose to desert the military.

They also believe that differences of opinion on social issues are increasing, according to the latest survey on citizen perspectives from the Netherlands Institute for Social Research (SCP), the government agency that studies social aspects of political policy.Although the Dutch have been concerned about polarization for years, researchers do not see a clear increase in hardened differences of opinion, according to the SCP.In fact, there is more agreement on many subjects than people think and, according to new research, differences in views are not growing. This study also states that two-thirds of the Dutch believe that others can be trusted. At the same time, people think that opinions are expressed in a more extreme and often harsher way, especially in media and social media, and during political debate.People generally, but not always, experience less polarization in their personal lives. Coronavirus is an exception, because it is a subject that affects everyone, according to the SCP. ""Discussions about vaccination have strained relations in many families and friend circles,"" the study said.In general, the Dutch people surveyed think that small groups with loud, harsh voices in particular demand and receive a lot of attention in the public debate. The respondents are particularly annoyed by people with contrarian opinions, such as those who support conspiracy theories, opponents of the coronavirus measures, anti-vaccination proponents, radical right-wing politicians, or groups that express themselves in an anti-democratic or racist manner.Others are annoyed by groups that speak out about climate change, LGBTQ rights, or racism.Two surveys were conducted for this study.

The newspaper said the man was shot in the leg.The witness and another believed the incident was related to a domestic situation, as the man had earlier tried to visit his children who were with his ex-girlfriend. The earlier situation escalated, and police were called to the scene. He returned later, which again escalated. This time, shots were fired.Police said three arrests were made in the incident. The situation was still under investigation.In a separate incident, police also responded to reports of gunfire on Opheusdenhof in Amsterdam-Zuidoost.

In doing so, the judges essentially tossed out the Cabinet's restrictions on allowing the family members to travel to the Netherlands.The Cabinet filed an application for an injunction against the lower court rulings with the Council of State. It initiated this step in anticipation of a planned appeal process, which State Secretary Eric van der Burg for asylum policy already announced on Friday.This concerned refugee status holders who were plaintiffs in four different court cases ruled on last week. Each of the courts ruled that the restriction imposed by the government on family reunification violated the law. As a result, the courts said the family members of the refugee status holders who had gone to court over the issue were allowed to enter the Netherlands. However, the state secretary wants to put a stop to that, according to a letter he wrote to the Tweede Kamer on Tuesday.The refugee advocacy group, VluchtelingenWerk Nederland, said it was not surprised that the Cabinet is seeking legal action to delay the arrival of the family members. ""We have already taken this into account. It's a pity that it had to come like this,"" a spokesperson for the organization said.The administrative law department of the Council of State will decide on the injunction Thursday afternoon or Friday morning, according to a Council of State spokesperson. The Council will issue a full ruling on the Cabinet's appeal in January. No hearing dates have yet been announced.In anticipation of the preliminary injunction, the Council of State decided that Van der Burg did not have to immediately issue entry documents for family members of a Turkish refugee status holder. The Amsterdam court ruled on Friday afternoon that such a temporary residence permit (mvv) for the family members must be issued within 24 hours. This may still be necessary if the Council of State rejects the request for a temporary injunction.The Cabinet decided at the end of August to impose the entry delay on family members of recognized refugees. The Cabinet gave the government a maximum of 15 months to issue visas after the submission of the application for family reunification. However, if the refugee status holder already has housing secured for his or her family members, the visa will be granted earlier. The measure is temporary and intended to last next year as a way of relieving the pressure on the overburdened asylum system, according to the Cabinet.Van der Burg announced on Friday that he would appeal to the Council of State, the highest administrative court, after lower courts again ruled that the entry restriction violated numerous national and international conventions. Therefore, the Cabinet wants a definitive answer from the Council of State whether the regulation is legally tenable or not.",28 December 2022 - 13:32,Politics
502,https://nltimes.nl/2022/12/28/employees-will-37-percent-salary-next-year,Employees will have 3.7 percent more of their salary next year,"Employees with an average income will keep 3,7 percent more of their salary next year. Due to changes in tax regulations, they will retain 91 euros more net per month of their gross salary of 3086 euros, as calculated by payroll service provider ADP. People on minimum wage or just above will benefit even more, because the net minimum wage will increase by 218 euros per month.Those earning one and a half times the modal rate, will keep 87 euros more per month. If the salary is twice as high, they will receive 98 euros more net.There are several reasons for the income increases. For most groups, the main reason is higher employment tax credit, which is an amount that is deducted from taxes. In addition, the tax rate decreases a bit and applies to a higher salary.Furthermore, the minimum wage will increase by more than 10 percent due to an additional increase. This affects not only people who earned the minimum wage in 2022, but also those who were just above it. In 2024, the minimum wage will increase again, as the government is no longer referring to a monthly minimum wage, but to a minimum hourly wage. Once this is in place, the government anticipates a 36-hour workweek, whereas the monthly minimum wage currently expects a 40-hour work week.People receiving AOW benefits will also profit by this. Single people will receive 92 euros more per month, while married couples will receive 57 euros more per month twice. However, a supplementary pension of 1,000 euros gross per month hardly brings anything extra. Of this, pensioners keep 2 euros more net per month.In addition, there are other benefits for employees, as ADP pointed out. For example, employers can grant a higher untaxed travel allowance and also more allowances for working from home. The travel allowance will increase from 0,19 to 0,21 cents per kilometer, and the home-work allowance will increase from 2 euros to 2,15 euros per day. This leaves it up to employers to decide whether they want to implement these changes..In general, ADP processes about 1.2 million pay slips in the Netherlands each month. The pay slip processor's figures are in line with data released last week by industry peer Visma Raet. That company only looks at payrolls in the healthcare, education and public sectors.",28 December 2022 - 11:25,Business

The newspaper published the interview on Wednesday.
The coalition agreement that led to the formation of the fourth Cabinet under Prime Minister Mark Rutte at the start of 2022 calls for the Netherlands to build about 100,000 new homes per year through 2030. However, the population grew by 191,000 people just in the first nine months of the year, with the final total expected to be around 227,000. ""If the immigration results remain as it stands, 900,000 homes in 2030 will not be enough,” De Jonge said. The housing shortage will only be exacerbated every year the population increase due to immigration is so high even after accounting for emigration, he continued. “The immigration balance must go down.”
A large portion of the population increase this year was due to nearly 318,000 people who settled in the Netherlands between January and the end of September, including 97,000 who fled the war in Ukraine. About 129,000 people left the Netherlands this year, meaning over 98 percent of the population increase this year was driven by immigration.
""We will have to plan our demographics, because, in fact, we are heading for 19 million people in 2034 if nothing changes. We need to form an idea about how many people we can live here with and how much growth can really be accommodated in the Netherlands,"" De Jonge said. The Cabinet needs to get a better handle on the situation, whether immigration is linked to asylum, love, family reunification, or international students, the minister said. Without a comprehensive approach, politicians end up putting too much of the burden on society as a whole.
“And then we undermine support for immigration in a country where we will also need immigration. But the current growth in the number of people in our country is potentially disruptive.""
The problem is not new, and as a whole, successive governments have thus far “failed people” when it comes to handling the housing shortage over the years, the minister said. “We have let it get to the point where the shortage of suitable housing affects people’s livelihoods.”
The minister noted that over 20 years ago he was able to purchase his first home in Carnisse for 64,000 guilders, but his children will not be in as positive a position when they reach their mid-twenties in 2030. “I was blissfully happy. You can no longer buy a garage for that money.”",28 December 2022 - 09:50,Politics

It's busy there, but manageable. That's according to the University Medical Center Groningen (UMCG) after a consultation between university hospitals on Tuesday. Chairman Károly Illy of the Dutch pediatric association confirmed the outcome.One of the reasons for the high hospital utilization is the RS virus, a respiratory infection that circulates every year during the cold months. Adults can catch a bad cold from the virus, but it can cause severe shortness of breath in babies. Furthermore, the flu epidemic also contributes to the crowds in hospitals.The Netherlands has seven pediatric intensive care units (ICU), which are part of the university hospitals. According to UMCG, it can handle the crowds because of good cooperation with general hospitals. For example, a child who has recovered sufficiently can be transferred from the ICU to a nursing unit in a regular hospital.The Groningen teaching hospital sometimes transfers 16- and 17-year-olds to adult intensive care units.

The Mandela Bridge is an important link for the city of Zoetermeer and the only way to reach Zoetermeer station, among other places. In addition to the A12, a rail line and the RandstadRail also pass under the bridge.It should be possible to use the bridge again on January 15.",27 December 2022 - 13:20,Politics

De Meij therefore sees this New Year's Eve as the ""ultimate test.In the past two years, there was a total ban on fireworks because of Covid-19, which led to ewer arrests and incidents. ""As far as the police is concerned, if this decline continues, next New Year's Eve will be a success,"" the coordinator of the police said.In the run-up to New Year, the police paid specific attention to serious illegal fireworks. For instance, 600,000 kilos were recently seized that were destined for the Dutch market.Despite the shortage of personnel, the police stated they will mobilize enough people for New Year. When possible, drones will also be used to track rioters. However, there were concerns about the strength of the fireworks and the fact that they would be thrown at emergency personnel.

536,https://nltimes.nl/2022/12/27/municipalities-block-renewing-passports-people-outstanding-debts,Municipalities block renewing passports for people with outstanding debts ,"Citizens who have high pending debts to their municipalities will not be able to renew their passports. However, Dutch municipalities handle debtors noted as ""lost"" differently. Some conduct this arbitrary measure often, others less frequently or never, reported the newspaper Trouw. The mandatory measure mainly affects people who have not repaid their high amount of social benefits to the municipality. In this process, the affected people are registered by government organizations in the passport warning register of the Ministry of Interior. As a result, the flagged people cannot continue to renew their passports at places that issue passports. The flagged citizens are divided into two groups in the warning register. he first group includes persons suspected of passport fraud, and the second group is composed of persons with outstanding debts of more than 5,000 euros, whose home address cannot be located. The last category includes about 4,000 out of 8,000 citizens recorded in the database in 2021, according to Trouw. However, the way Dutch municipalities deal with citizens whose debts are still outstanding varies. In Tilburg, for example, 66 debtors are affected by the arbitrary measure and will not have their passports renewed. However, this number is disproportionate to Amsterdam, which is four times larger, where only one person cannot renew his passport, wrote the Dutch newspaper. ",27 December 2022 - 10:51,Politics

However, a few days before the turn of the year, it remains inconsistent. When the temporary excise tax reduction expires during the course of next year, prices are likely to rise again significantly.On Monday, the national recommended retail price for a liter of Euro95 was 1,899 euros, according to figures from consumer collective UnitedConsumers. That is significantly lower than the 2,111 euros around New Year's Eve at the beginning of this year. But in March, the price per liter was briefly above 2,50 euros.However, gas station owners can deviate from the price recommendations of the major oil companies. Normally, motorists only pay these prices on the highway. But in order to provide some relief to motorists, the government decided on April 1 to reduce the excise tax. Including VAT, this meant a price drop of more than 20 cents per liter.Later, oil prices worldwide rose again due to the European boycott of Russian oil. As a result, the petrol prices in the Netherlands peaked again at over 2,50 euros in June. As the oil markets calmed down again, gasoline also gradually became cheaper here. This was partly due to expectations that demand for oil in China would decline as a result of slower economic growth there. A recession is now also looming in many Western economies.However, diesel costs more than at the beginning of the year. The average recommended retail price is now 1,892 euros, compared with 1,741 almost 12 months ago. Diesel was sometimes even more expensive than gasoline this year. This was due to the high demand for the substance, which was also in demand in the industry- and transport sector. Experts pointed out that there has been a shortage of diesel fuel in Europe for some time. Until this year, this problem was solved by supplying diesel from Russia, which is no longer possible.
How prices at the pump will continue to develop depends on several factors. For example, it will also depend on whether the major oil states of the oil cartel OPEC want to further reduce their production in order to prop up prices. The reduction in excise duty on fuels in the Netherlands was actually supposed to last until the end of this year.However, the government extended the measure until the middle of next year. After that, the intervention will be phased out. Sooner or later, motorists will have no choice but to pay more taxes again when filling up.",27 December 2022 - 09:45,Politics

This is in large part due to the flu epidemic and the respiratory syncytial virus, also known as RSV or RS-Virus, said the association.The seven university hospitals will meet on Tuesday to discuss the situation, confirmed Károly Illy of the Dutch Association of Pediatrics. The situation was first reported by RTL Nieuws.Renze Jongstra, a nurse at the Leiden University Medical Center, said that the problems are exacerbated because there are also no beds available for patients in the countries which border the Netherlands, meaning patients cannot be transferred to facilities in Germany or Belgium. The dire situation has arisen because there has been a shortage of nurses for years, according to Jongstra.To accommodate all children, extra beds are being added to the existing units. This results in a single nurse being forced to help more patients than desired. Alternatively, ICU nurses are transferred from the adult wards or the neonatal intensive care units where newborn babies receive treatment. ""However, that is not desirable for the patient and also not good for the workload experienced by the nurses,"" Jongstra said.The pediatric ICUs are always fuller in the winter than in other seasons, but this year there seem to be more children with respiratory infections, Jongstra said.

At the IKEA in Amsterdam there were still long queues at the cash registers at the end of the afternoon.Manager Gerard Niesink from the Intratuin in Duiven explained that his store usually attracts a lot of people on December 26. That's when the annual Christmas sale starts at the garden center. ""Last two years we were only closed because of coronavirus. But now it's possible again. It was certainly just as busy as before coronavirus.""He said he thinks thousands of people visited the store on Monday. ""The people who queue up so early often know exactly what they want,"" said Niesink.In the IKEA in Amsterdam it was still quite busy as the sun began to set. According to an ANP reporter at the location, there were mainly many families and couples who wanted to look at new furniture or find new inspiration. However, the queues at the checkout were not just a result of the crowds, but it was also because not all cash registers were open. The Swedish retailer announced several months ago that staff shortages forced it to close its stores in the Netherlands earlier.The scene was very different at the Praxis nearby. It was very quiet there on Sunday afternoon. Only a handful of people walked around the aisles of the hardware store. ""And this is actually the busiest time of the day,"" said one employee. Easter Monday is when the crowds really fill the store, he also noted.The situation was also hit-or-miss elsewhere.

Organizations that do not comply with the rule will lose their permit to operate in the country. It concerns more than 180 domestic and international NGOs.The fundamentalist government also decided last week to bar women from universities and other higher education because they were not following the dress code, and they had contact with male students.

The tighter ECB policy is only just reaching a midway point, suggested DNB leader Klaas Knot.“The risk of us doing too little is still the bigger risk,” Knot told the Financial Times in an interview published on Monday. “We are just at the beginning of the second half.” The ECB has five policy meetings set through July 2023, and Knot predicted that further 0.5 percentage point increases can contribute to addressing the problems currently faced across Europe.The “main challenge,” he told the newspaper, is for policy-makers to determine when they have done enough.
