https://nltimes.nl/2023/01/02/one-professional-new-years-fireworks-show-set-amsterdam-monday,One more professional New Year's fireworks show set for Amsterdam on Monday,2 January 2023 - 16:27,"People still looking for some post-New Year's Eve entertainment will have a chance to check out one more event at the A'dam Toren in Amsterdam on Monday evening. The fireworks and drone show was postponed on New Year's Eve because of strong winds.The show will get underway at 8:23 p.m., and will alternate between a high-end fireworks production launched from the 100-meter tall, 22-storey tower, and designs made up of 600 different drones. The performance will last for about ten minutes, and will be synchronized to music available on the website of the organizer, Feelgood Vuurwerk.The organization sold fireworks packages in December to raise money for the Sheltersuit Foundation. The nonprofit group produces a coat that can transform into a sleeping back for people without a home or who are otherwise displaced. The windproof and waterproof product costs 300 euros, but is given away for free to homeless people and refugees, Sheltersuit said.The New Year's show was not the only one impacted by the windy weather on Saturday night. An event on Museumplein in Amsterdam still included a light and music show, but the official fireworks were cancelled, even though many hobbyists in the neighborhood set them off anyway.The National Fireworks showcase in Rotterdam was also cancelled. Shows organized at the Hofvijver in The Hague, and in Hilversum, Apeldoorn, and Zoetermeer were also scrapped.The traditional New Year's bonfires on Scheveningen and Duindorp, permitted for the first time since the outbreak of the coronavirus, were lit a day early instead of risking another incident caused by smoldering embers blown over buildings in the area.A post shared by A'DAM Toren (@adam_toren)",CultureEntertainment

The police accused the group of younger people in about seventy stabbing incidents in 2022, the highest number in recent years. Ten people died from those incidents in 2022, more than in 2020 and 2021 combined. Youth care workers previously issued warnings about young people more often being found in possession of weapons.Police reported 67 stabbing incidents with teenage suspects last year. The final known case in 2022 took place in Bladel, Noord-Brabant on New Year's Eve where an 18-year-old boy was stabbed to death. A resident of the municipality, also 18, was arrested for the crime, but the motive is still unknown. At the end of October, a 14-year-old boy was stabbed to death at his school in Hoorn in an incident that shocked area residents, which led to the arrest of a 16-year-old boy. Other fatal stabbings in 2022 took place in Middelburg, Amsterdam, Horst, Rosmalen, Breda, Vlaardingen, Vlissingen and Nijmegen.In all of 2021, according to police reports, teenagers were involved in nearly 50 stabbings. Three of these had fatal consequences. A 17-year-old boy was killed in an attack in The Hague. Friends of that victim were said to have stabbed a 14-year-old boy at another location in The Hague shortly before, for which his friends then wanted to take revenge. In Rozenburg, a village in the municipality of Rotterdam, a 17-year-old allegedly stabbed a 21-year-old to death, and in Rijswijk a 26-year-old walking in the park was stabbed to death by a 16-year-old seemingly at random.In 2020, the police reported nearly sixty stabbing incidents carried out by teenagers, which caused four deaths in total. Two fatal stabbings that year happened in Rotterdam, the other two in Alphen aan den Rijn and at the Scheveningen Pier. There were six deaths out of almost sixty cases of knife violence in 2019. Three people died that year in The Hague, with the others killed in Amsterdam, Breda and Hoofddorp.In total, the police reported 228 stabbing incidents by teenagers in the past four years. Most of these happened in Rotterdam. The city has had thirty reported cases in the past four years. This is followed by The Hague with 26 incidents. Amsterdam had nine stabbing incidents involving teenage suspects in the past four years. There were six incidents in Breda, Spijkenisse and Goes, and five in Hoofddorp. Groningen, Zoetermeer, Purmerend and Middelburg had four cases and Beverwijk, Rijswijk, Roosendaal, Schiedam, Vlaardingen and Zaandam each had three.Zuid-Holland leads the list among the provinces. There were a total of 94 reported stabbing incidents by teenagers in 2019, 2020, 2021 and 2022. Noord-Holland had 47 cases, Noord-Brabant 22, Gelderland 18, Zeeland 17, while Groningen, Limburg and Utrecht each had six. That was followed by Flevoland with five, three in Overijssel, and two in both Drenthe and Friesland.The figures are based on reports from the police in which the ages of the suspects were mentioned, or in which the police explicitly said that the suspects are teenagers, minors, boys or girls. When the police left this unstated, the incident was not included on the list. The overview also does not include whether the Public Prosecution Service has prosecuted the suspect, or whether a suspect has been convicted or acquitted. As a result, more data is needed before a final accounting can be made.",Crime

As a result, gas reserves in Europe are still largely up to standard.The price of a megawatt hour of gas on the leading stock exchange in Amsterdam fell to 70.30 euros on Monday morning. The last time European gas was at this low price was in February 2022 before the war in Ukraine began.

It was previously known that this person was going to be permanently blind in one eye, but the eye turned out to be so badly damaged that it had to be removed completely, she said.The patient will receive a prosthetic eye. In total, the Rotterdam Eye Hospital has so far treated 25 people with serious eye injuries caused by fireworks. The figure rose from 17 earlier on New Year’s Day morning, to 24 by the end of Sunday afternoon.The youngest victim so far is seven years old, and five of the victims are under the age of 17. Seven people had to undergo surgery. For example, so much gunpowder wound up in their eyes, that debris had to be removed with tweezers, according to the hospital spokesperson. It is not yet possible to say how many of the victims will have permanent injuries because of the celebrations at the turn of the new year. They will first have to recover over the coming days.During the New Year’s period bringing in the start of 2020, the hospital treated eighteen patients with eye injuries caused by fireworks. During the two years after when coronavirus restrictions were in place, the hospital treated far fewer eye patients. On January 1, 2022, the Rotterdam Eye Hospital treated five fireworks victims. None of them underwent surgery at the time.The figure returning to pre-Covid levels prompted means, “We’re back to square one,” said one of the hospital’s ophthalmologists, Tjeerd de Faber, during an interview. ""It's a shame that this has to be the price of celebrating New Year's again.""The number of victims at the start of 2021 was so low due to coronavirus restrictions, that he called it his “calmest New Year’s Eve in 34 years.” A year later, his hospital treated five victims in total. This year, De Faber expected at least five of the patients brought to the hospital to have permanent damage.De Faber has been arguing for years for a permanent nationwide ban on fireworks to prevent eye injuries from fireworks.",Health1-1-2

Rotterdam will take the dubious title of murder capital of the Netherlands for 2022. Sixteen people were killed by violence there. The city is followed by Amsterdam, where eleven people were killed.The national figure of 133 was determined by the newspaper using data provided by the regional police districts and website Moordatlas.nl. The website tracks all cases of murder and manslaughter in the Netherlands.The figure is nearly six percent higher than in 2021, when 126 people were killed, according to Statistics Netherlands. The current total is ten percent higher than in 2020, when there were 121 victims of murder or manslaughter.Male victims accounted for at least 80 of the victims, almost double the number of female victims, 41. The preliminary data shows 12 of the victims were below the age of 18. Three of them, two girls and a boy, were babies or toddlers. Seven of the children were boys between 4-17 years of age, while two others were girls in the same age group.With 16 victims, Rotterdam had more murder or manslaughter incidents than any other municipality in the Netherlands. The greater Rotterdam area accounted for 26 victims in total. Rotterdam is the largest city in the province of Zuid-Holland, which also had the highest number of victims, 35, compared to any other province.""This year's statistics are very sad. Every victim is one too many,” said Brigitte Nolden, the head of the Rotterdam police district’s regional detective’s division. “The impact is enormous, because behind every victim are next of kin,"" Nolden told the newspaper.Noord-Holland and Noord-Brabant each had 22 victims, the newspaper reported, followed by Limburg with 16. Gelderland and Zeeland both had eight violent deaths, while Overijssel had six.Preliminary data identified three victims in Flevoland, and two victims each in Drenthe, Friesland and Groningen.Data reviewed by AD last week put the number of victims in the city of Utrecht at zero, with three murder or manslaughter cases in The Hague.

He previously gave the government a score of six, which he said was a generous rating at best. Now, looking back over the entirety of 2022, he said the government rating did not improve, “because they have failed, and they simply do not keep their promises,"" he told the newspaper.He said the government is simply not learning from past mistakes. Because in the southern part of Limburg, for example, the same errors are being repeated with money for flood damage repairs as were made in Groningen with money given out for repairs for earthquake damages.In the upcoming year, he is most concerned that people will still be mistrustful of the government. ""I also understand after all the misery it has caused. They feel as though the government is really sitting opposite of them instead of next to them. It is a bad development,” Van Zutphen said.When asked whether he still has faith in politics, Van Zutphen stated, ""I tend to say no."" He points out that tens of thousands of people have run into major problems because of the government decision making, such as those most affected by the consequences of drilling for natural gas in Groningen, and the victims of the tax office’s child benefits scandal. Thousands of parents were reviewed by an algorithm, which also included racial or ethnic profiling characteristics, and were falsely identified as frauds.They were then cut off from benefits without a fair review, and forced to repay the entirety of the benefits received in the past, placing many into insurmountable debt. The scandal led to the resignation of Prime Minister Mark Rutte’s third Cabinet, however a year after Rutte’s fourth Cabinet took office, many victims have yet to be fully compensated.""In Limburg, citizens are still waiting for their money, a year and a half after the floods. While in a prosperous country like ours you would assume that everything is well organized. And the government knows what needs to be done to solve it,” Van Zutphen said.He also does not feel supported by the Tweede Kamer either. The lower house of Dutch parliament appointed Van Zutphen to the role. He said it was “shocking” that he has to repeat the same story time and time again. “You then experience a lot of sympathy and a listening ear,” he continued, saying it makes him believe work will actually be completed and the situation will be improved.”But if you have to keep singing the same tune a year later because nothing happened...,” said the National Ombudsman. ""Yes, then you sometimes become despondent and you wonder why parliament has actually appointed you and asks you for advice. In any case, there is still little sign of that new administrative culture.""Reporting by ANP and NL Times",Politics

Two Dutch men they were skiing with were not injured, but two German people were also hurt at the same location soon after the incident involving the Dutch people.It happened on New Year’s Day at about 10:15 a.m., according to a press release from LPD Tirol, the local police. The two Dutch couples were on the Number 1 red run at the glacier, known as Black Pan, which was icy at the time. The two men in the group navigated the piste without an issue, but the Dutch women both fell independently of each other.The 28-year-old woman slid uncontrolled for about 100 meters down the slope before crashing through a safety net. She then dropped about 20 meters, and struck a tree at full speed. Her injuries were fatal, police said.Her 27-year-old friend fell at almost the same time, police said. She slid over the edge of the slope, then fell into a rocky area. “The woman sustained serious injuries. She was flown to Kufstein Hospital in a rescue helicopter and transferred from there to the Innsbruck Clinic,” police said.Just 30 minutes later, a 55-year-old German woman crashed on the same run and also slid over the edge of the slope, dropping about 10 meters into a “rocky, lightly wooded area,” police said. She was also brought by helicopter to the Innsbruck Clinic with serious injuries.At a different run on the same glacier, a 56-year-old German man also suffered an eye injury when he fell and crashed into a piste sign. He was also flown to the Innsbruck Clinic. About an hour later at 3:30 p.m., not far from there at the Ischgl ski area, a boulder rolled down a black run and struck a 49-year-old German on the thigh. He was taken by helicopter to an area hospital with a serious leg injury, police said.A 40-year-old German was also badly injured at Obendorf after falling on a black run. He then slid about 300 meters in an uncontrolled manner. He was rescued by a helicopter crew who took him to a hospital in Salzburg.Several other Dutch people were hurt earlier in the ski season, according to NOS. A 12-year-old girl died over Christmas when she skied off-piste and struck a tree.A 62-year-old Dutch woman was also seriously hurt that Sunday.

https://nltimes.nl/2023/01/02/kia-beats-volkswagen-take-top-spot-popular-car-brand-netherlands,Kia beats Volkswagen to take top spot as most popular car brand in Netherlands,2 January 2023 - 08:50,"New cars produced by South Korean brand Kia were the most popular choice by consumers in the Netherlands last year. It was the first time in 17 years that Volkswagen was not the number one brand in the country. The annual analysis of the Dutch passenger vehicle market found that Kia represented 30,036 total vehicle registrations, worth 9.6 percent market share. An estimated 312,129 new passenger cars were registered after purchase in the Netherlands last year, a 3.2 percent decrease compared to the previous year. Volkswagen came in second place, with 25,993 vehicles for 8.3 percent of the market. The German brand delivered about 600 more vehicles than Toyota, which trailed closely behind at 8.1 percent of market share. Peugeot came in fourth place. The 21,242 Peugeot models purchased new in 2022 represented 6.8 percent of the Dutch market, beating out BMW, which held 5.5 percent of the market with 17,138 units purchased.Even though the brand came in fourth, the Peugeot 208 was the most popular new car model, which was registered 9,640 times last year. The Kia Picanto (7,391) and Kia Niro (7,277) came in second and third place, respectively. That was followed by the Volvo XC40 (6,821), and the Opel Corsa (6,669).The report also showed that that share of all-electric models rose to nearly one-fourth of all new car purchases in the country in 2022, according to BOVAG, RAI and RDC. “At 23.5 percent, the share of electric cars out of the total number of registrations was somewhat higher than one year previously,” the organizations wrote in a statement. About 19.8 percent of all new cars sold in 2021 were all-electric models.Despite last year’s drop in deliveries, a total of 340,000 new cars are expected to be registered in the Netherlands in 2023, both BOVAG and RAI. In the report, it was noted that for two years in a row, the automotive industry “was faced with supply problems last year due to global shortages to computer chips and other components.”The auto industry organizations believe manufacturers will catch up on fulfilling orders that were delayed in 2022, leading to a higher number of vehicles registered on Dutch roads. However, there is still uncertainty due to “global and domestic economic and geopolitical developments, not least of which is driven by the war in Ukraine.”Electric cars should continue to be a popular choice with the Dutch government offering consumers 67 million euros in subsidies. The government will provide 2,950 euros for new electric cars purchased with a maximum price of 45,000 euros. Last year, the subsidy ran out about halfway through the year. People who use their company cars for unlimited private use still have to pay a tax for the privilege, however the amount is capped for electric car users.",Business
https://nltimes.nl/2023/01/02/mayors-renew-call-national-fireworks-ban-new-years-incidents-police-unions-agree,Mayors renew call for national fireworks ban after New Year’s incidents; Police unions agree,2 January 2023 - 07:50,"Amsterdam Mayor Femke Halsema issued ""another urgent appeal"" to the Cabinet to implement a national ban on consumer fireworks after what she said was a tense and difficult New Year’s period in the capital. Similar statements were made by Nijmegen Mayor Hubert Bruls, who is also the chair of the Security Council, as well as the chair of the NPB and ANPV police labor unions.Even though there is a ban on detonating fireworks in Amsterdam, the problems arose because the rules have not been coordinated nationally, Halsema said. She took to Instagram, calling it an ""unsustainable situation.""Halsema went on ride-alongs with the emergency services in the overnight period from Saturday into Sunday and noted that despite the ban, many fireworks were detonated. ""The fire brigade worked all night to extinguish and prevent fires. Police officers and [BOA] enforcers had their hands full maintaining public order and supporting the fire brigade and other emergency services.""A fireworks ban during the turn of the new year will only be effective if one national policy is drawn up. Otherwise, it is an ""unwinnable competition"" if only a few municipalities try to enforce a fireworks ban, Bruls said on Sunday. The Netherlands is too small for such differences in policy, he believes.Nijmegen was one of the twelve municipalities in the Netherlands with a fireworks ban, but in Nijmegen, like everywhere else, a large number of firecrackers, bottle rockets, and decorative fireworks flew into the air around midnight. ""I think the explosions were less and there were also neighborhoods where it was really quiet. But it cannot be denied that many were fired off,” he said.Bruls stated that the municipalities with a fireworks ban have had a great deal of trouble because of the different rules from city to city, and “you cannot compete” with ministers who think shooting off fireworks is “a fine tradition."" Such conflicting messages make it more difficult to convince people to comply with rules. “There really needs to be a good conversation about how we in this country are going to deal with fireworks in the coming years and how we are going to enforce it. I advocate a multi-year plan.""De nachtdienst van @DePolitieheli wenst iedereen een mooi, gezond en veilig 2023 toe! ^cw pic.twitter.com/dkrJAflzQAAccording to the police unions, it was a busy New Year's Eve for police officers in many places and there were many incidents such as vandalism and arson. Several officers suffered injuries, such as hearing damage, because they were pelted with fireworks. In the big cities in particular, the police had their hands full and often intervened just in time before a situation got out of hand, said NPB chairman Jan Struijs. ""There were no major incidents, but a hundred minor incidents is just as bad as one major incident. This cannot be the new normal. New Year's Eve should be a folk festival with a socially safe character, but it certainly isn't yet. In some places was it unsafe or even very unsafe.""Xander Simonis of the ANPV said that the fireworks ban seems to have been ignored in almost all places where it was in force. In Amsterdam, Rotterdam, Schiedam and Haarlem, among others, no fireworks were allowed to be set off this past New Year’s. Moving decision-making on the policy from the national level to local governments “does not work at all,” Simonis said. ""We have to do something about that. If you prohibit lighting fireworks in your municipality but allow sales, for example, then that cannot be enforced.""According to Struijs, police officers repeatedly complain about the current fireworks policy. ""How credible are we as a constitutional state if we say that a fireworks ban applies in twelve municipalities, and not in the three hundred others? We need clear policy, then such a ban must apply to all municipalities. This year it was too unclear.""Nijmegen had eight arrests for misconduct with fireworks before the turn of the year. Many fireworks were also confiscated. During the New Year’s Eve and New Year’s Day festivities, the police largely did not intervene. It had been agreed in advance that this would only happen in the event of the most egregious situations, which, according to Bruls, did not materialize.""It was really less, but I still have mixed feelings about it. It remains a ridiculous night in terms of the deployment of emergency services and incidents. It really needs to be quieter and therefore more fun.""Despite figures being similar to the coronavirus pandemic years when fireworks were banned nationally, the Security Council said the New Year’s period was the busiest 24 hour period of the year for aid workers. Bruls chairs the Council, which is made up of 25 mayors in total, each representing a region in the Netherlands.According to the municipality of Amsterdam, considerably more people were arrested in the capital this New Year’s than last year. In some places, rioters threw heavy fireworks at police officers, BOA street enforcement teams, and aid workers. According to the municipality, it was particularly restless in Amsterdam-West and on Dam Square.",Crime1-1-2Politics

https://nltimes.nl/2023/01/01/3800-fire-incidents-new-years-significant-church-school-badly-damaged,"Over 3,800 fire incidents during New Year’s; Significant church, school badly damaged",1 January 2023 - 15:54,"The fire departments in the Netherlands received thousands of reports about incidents across the country on New Year’s Eve and early on New Year’s Day. The incidents include a large fire in a Veghel church that is a historic monument, in a primary school building with a thatched roof, and a daycare center in Amsterdam.The fire service received 3,833 reports of incidents nationwide during the new year’s period the fire brigade reported on the basis of an initial inventory among the 25 security regions in the Netherlands. That number is comparable to the last two New Year’s Eve periods, when fireworks were still banned due to the coronavirus crisis. In the year before the crisis, the number of reports to the fire service were well over 4,000.This year more residential fires were reported than a year earlier: about 134 residential fires compared to 97 last year. On a ""normal day"" there are an average of 19 residential fires, based on the annual figures for 2021. During New Year's Eve 2021 into New Year’s Day 2022 there were almost five times as many. The fire service also received about 724 reports of container fires and 183 of car fires, both numbers slightly less than last year.The very large fire that broke out after midnight in a monumental side building of the Sint-Lambertus Church in Veghel in Noord-Brabant was brought under control, said the Brabant-Noord Security Region. Many firefighters and multiple pieces of equipment rolled out to the scene. Personnel let the fire in the “monumental building to burn out in a controlled manner,” said the security region.“Due to the favorable wind direction, the adjacent church was not in danger,” the security region said on Twitter. The fire was raging in the congregation chapel, a small building that currently serves as a mosque. The security region reported earlier in the night that the annex would probably completely burn down.Ladder trucks and cherry pickers were on the scene to help extinguish the fire from above. The cause of the fire was not immediately known. According to the spokesperson, there were no initial reports that anyone was involved in the fire or was injured. Firefighters also drove tanker trucks around the area looking for fires caused by burning embers spread by the strong wind.The neo-Gothic church, located on the Deken van Miertstraat, was designed by Pierre Cuypers. The extension behind it was also designed by Cuypers. Both buildings are considered national monuments. Cuypers also designed the building that houses the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam, the capital’s central train station, and several other churches in the country.In Utrecht, a fire started on New Year's Eve in the Rietendakschool in the Ondiep district. The fire brigade suspects that fireworks caused the flames in the thatched building built in 1923. The fire was brought under control, reported the Utrecht Security Region.It was a raging fire and ""visible flames"" were extinguished, the service said on Twitter. Specialists in dealing with reeds that catch fire were deployed to keep the fire from re-igniting. The fire damage was limited to the thatched roof, and there was smoke and water damage in the building, the service said. The cause is still under investigation.""We hope that we can save the building,"" a spokesperson said earlier. Because according to him it would be an eternal shame if society lost such a beautiful building, designed in the Amsterdam School architectural style.Fire broke out at the school on four other occasions. None of those incidents took place during the New Year’s period in other years.Several fires broke out in Amsterdam during the turn of the new year. Damage was also caused by fireworks or vandalism. For example, a daycare center on the Markengouw in Amsterdam-Noord suffered major damage due to fireworks. According to the fire service, all windows and facades were completely blown out causing an immense havoc.A fire also raged in a gymnasium of a school on Zuid-Hollandstraat in the Buitenveldert neighborhood. Vandals likely threw a wheelie bin on fire through the window there, according to a spokesperson.Earlier on New Year's Eve, a fire raged in a house at Ubbo Emmiushof in Nieuw-West, which was probably caused by fireworks. Two people suffered smoke inhalation, according to the fire service. They were evaluated by paramedics.The Amsterdam fire brigade was particularly busy with many reports that came in after midnight. Those included container and roadside fires.The mayor of Arnhem, Ahmed Marcouch, tried to carry on a New Year’s tradition started by Herman Kaiser, his predecessor. While Kaiser was mayor from 2013 to 2017, he would eat dinner with firefighters on New Year’s Eve.Marcouch wanted to do the same on Saturday evening, but the firefighters were called out to an emergency. ""The celebration of the New Year is the largest and perhaps the most dangerous event in the Netherlands. And this is only possible because people from the fire brigade, police and ambulance are ready for us to celebrate that party.""In some regions, there were people who threw fireworks at the fire brigade. Police and riot police were needed to help guarantee firefighters’ safety in several parts of the country, including the Haaglanden, Hollands-Midden and Gelderland-Zuid Security Regions. Tijs van Lieshout, the chair of the country’s fire service, said aggression and violence are “never acceptable.” He said first responders should never be the target of verbal or physical abuse “with or without fireworks.”Thousands of firefighters are at the ready every year during New Year's Eve. Van Lieshout emphasized that it is the busiest time of the year for the fire brigade. The firefighters often have to deal with garbage container fires, car fires and outdoor fires. In previous years, most reports came in around midnight.Reporting by ANP and NL Times",Crime
https://nltimes.nl/2023/01/01/vlaardingen-surpassed-hague-worst-air-quality-new-years,Vlaardingen surpassed The Hague for worst air quality on New Year’s,1 January 2023 - 13:20,"The poorest air quality in the Netherlands at the start of New Year’s Day was measured in Vlaardingen. The Zuid-Holland city displaced nearby The Hague, which had the worst air quality early on January 1, 2022.“In the first hours of 2023, short-term smog caused by particulate matter was measured in many cities in the Netherlands,” said public health institute RIVM. This was caused by fireworks set off to celebrate the new year. “As a result, the air quality was very poor in places for a short time, according to the Dutch Air Quality Index.”The RIVM said that the highest concentration of particulate matter was found in Vlaardingen, where the measurement equaled 850 micrograms per cubic meter of air. In The Hague, the total from from 855 last year to 719 this year. The average was 178 in the first hour of the new year.The high levels of particulate matter can impair lung function, and cause coughing, shortness of breath, or wheezing. It can also exacerbate asthma symptoms, and symptoms from other pulmonary illnesses. The situation was at its worst in the larger municipalities, said RIVM air quality researcher Joost Wesseling in an interview with ANP. “Almost all major cities had high peaks. So there are still many people who had to deal with this poor air quality.""The poor air quality was short lived, the RIVM said. “Due to the high wind speeds, the concentrations quickly dropped to the values ​​before the fireworks.” A representative told the newswire that the air quality at 2:30 a.m. on New Year’s Day was about the same as at 8 p.m. the night before.""If fireworks are set off, or particulate matter is released into the air, then these weather conditions are actually the best,"" said Wesseling. ""In any case, fewer people suffer from it this way.""",Health
https://nltimes.nl/2023/01/01/dutch-police-firefighters-repeatedly-assaulted-turbulent-new-years,"Dutch police, firefighters repeatedly assaulted during turbulent New Year’s",1 January 2023 - 12:16,"Violence against first responders who were dispatched to handle incidents at the turn of the new year. Several police officers and firefighters were pelted with fireworks, causing injury in some instances, police said. More than ten officers were injured in The Hague alone.The incidents often involved very powerful fireworks, police said. “The fireworks tradition has become one in which colleagues suffer permanent hearing damage and other injuries every year. I'm angry about that. As a society, we need to think about better ways to ring in the new year,” said Police Chief Henk van Essen in a statement.Police and firefighters were assaulted in at least eight different municipalities. Several different incidents involving the division of the police in The Hague led to more than ten officers being hurt. “Some of them had to be taken to hospital for medical treatment,” police said.Aside from dozens of arrests in the three largest cities of the country, Amsterdam, Rotterdam and The Hague, there were several cases of violence and public disturbance in other municipalities. These were mainly individual incidents, police said. However, there were no “mass public disturbances.” Prosecutors can seek punishments that are three times as severe in cases of assault against first responders and other civil servants during performance of their jobsThe police department said two officers in Helmond were hospitalized after being assaulted with fireworks there, including one with hearing damage. The incident happened when they arrived at the train station there late Saturday afternoon after a group of young people were accused of causing a disturbance there. A police car was also destroyed in the city. At least 11 people were arrested in Helmond and the rest of the eastern portion of Noord-Brabant.One officer addressing a group of young people on Helsingborg in Schiedam was hurt after fireworks were shot at him from a home. He was hospitalized with hearing damage and burn wounds on his neck. One 17-year-old boy was arrested around 7 p.m. on New Year’s Eve.A group of about 20 young people also threw fireworks at firefighters while they tried extinguishing a car fire on Nijenhuis in Zeist.

There were no arrests.A 19-year-old was also taken into custody after he was accused of throwing powerful fireworks at firefighters extinguishing a fire. The incident happened at 3:10 a.m. on New Year’s Day.“In Geleen, the police took action against people who were throwing fireworks at a home at around 3:15 a.m. These people then turned on the officers and pelted them with fireworks,” police said. One person was arrested for assault.A police officer was also injured in Assen when chasing after young people in the neighborhood who may have set fire to a bus shelter on Europaweg Zuid. Fireworks were thrown at her, and she suffered hearing damage as a result.

https://nltimes.nl/2023/01/01/racist-messages-projected-erasmus-bridge-rotterdam-new-years-fest,Racist messages projected on Erasmus Bridge during Rotterdam New Year’s fest,1 January 2023 - 10:53,"This article was updated.A series of implicitly racist and discriminatory messages was projected in large letters on the side of the Erasmus Bridge in Rotterdam just after the turn of the new year early Sunday morning. The bridge was the center of the planned national fireworks show and televised celebration at the end of 2022 and start of 2023. The party went ahead even though the fireworks were cancelled due to high winds.stond er nou white lives matter op de erasmusbrug..... #Rotterdam pic.twitter.com/81zPcJWfg5Police are investigating how the disparaging messages were projected on the bridge, which could also be seen during the televised broadcast on RTL 4, a spokesperson told RTL Nieuws. “As we now estimate, the images were projected from a boat. The images move quite a bit. It is rather sloppy. We don't think this was done by the organization that normally handles the lighting of the bridge. But of course we are investigating that also.""The messages which appeared on the bridge included, “We must secure the existence of our people and a future for White children.” The statement is often referenced as “14 Words,” and was popularized by comments made by neo-Nazi David Lane. He died in prison in the U.S. after convictions related to the murder of Jewish radio host Alan Berg, and conspiracy and racketeering charges linked to the white supremacist organization he helped create.Other statements projected on the bridge included, “Vrolijk Blank 2023 - Happy White 2023,” and “Zwarte Piet deed niets verkeerd,” which translates to “Zwarte Piet did nothing wrong.” The Dutch word “Blank” is often considered by some to be antiquated and discriminatory as it can be used to imply superiority due to an absence of color rather than “white.” The message mentioning Zwarte Piet refers to the traditional winter holiday character often portrayed by white actors in blackface makeup, though support for the tradition has halved in recent years.Alderman Ronald Buijt, who is also the deputy mayor of the city, said to RTL Nieuws, “I found the slogans projected on the bridge tonight to be rude and polarizing. These guys don’t deserve attention even for a second. Rotterdam is one city, a city where everyone is equal.”Additionally, the slogan, “White Lives Matter,” was also projected on the bridge. The phrase was first heavily promoted in the United States by the Aryan Renaissance Society, a white supremacist group in Texas, and the Ku Klux Klan. “‘White Lives Matter’ is a white supremacist phrase that originated in early 2015 as a racist response to the Black Lives Matter movement, which arose to protest against police brutality against African-Americans and garnered considerable publicity in 2014 for protests in Ferguson, Missouri, following the shooting death of Michael Brown at the hands of a Ferguson police officer,” wrote the Anti-Defamation League. Based in New York, the organization has researched racism and discrimination for 110 years.The messages could clearly be seen in videos and images circulating on social media, in addition to the RTL 4 broadcast. The text was most legible to those standing on the quay, RTL Nieuws reported.“We were very shocked,” said one eyewitness to the broadcaster. “This is very cowardly and not okay. I think that something like this should not be possible in our society, especially not in Rotterdam.”",Crime1-1-2
https://nltimes.nl/2023/01/01/dozens-arrests-amsterdam-rotterdam-hague-new-years,"Dozens of arrests in Amsterdam, Rotterdam & The Hague during New Year’s",1 January 2023 - 09:54,"The police made dozens of arrests in Amsterdam around the turn of the year for several offenses, including setting off heavy fireworks and throwing them at police officers and bystanders. Police and riot police units also intervened at several locations in Rotterdam and The Hague, with about three dozen people arrested in Rotterdam alone.A police spokesperson in Amsterdam said on Sunday that no officers were injured overnight. ""But it is very intense when you are pelted with fireworks."" The arrests were made in various places in the city. ""We saw groups of people setting off heavy fireworks at various locations,"" said the spokesperson. Arrests have also been made for public order violations.The police were forced to take action and arrest people during a fight on Dam Square, where many people were gathered in groups. Officers there also confiscated fireworks, the spokesperson said. In Amsterdam there is a prohibition against setting off New Year’s fireworks, but this was almost completely ignored throughout the capital.Three people were injured by a stabbing incident on the Beursplein between Dam Square and Amsterdam’s Central Station. At least one person had to go to the hospital. The exact circumstances were still under investigation, the spokesperson said. There were no arrests as of early on New Year’s Day, she said.The police also had to intervene on Admiraal de Ruijterweg in Amsterdam-West. A number of people were arrested there for throwing fireworks.Due to the bad weather, the organized fireworks shows in Amsterdam did not take place or took place in an adapted format. For example, there was a show at the Museumplein, but it only included light and music with a countdown to the new year. The show with fireworks and drones at the A'DAM Toren will take place on Monday instead of the scheduled New Year’s event.The police in Rotterdam and the surrounding area arrested 35 people in the first hours after midnight on suspicion of involvement in various offenses. According to a spokesperson, the officers were busy, but the general situation was manageable despite many dozens of incidents.Even though there is a fireworks ban in Rotterdam, massive amounts of fireworks were set off in the city. The police and street enforcement teams largely did not intervene when observing people setting off fireworks.Police officers did have to take action in various places, including in the Crooswijk district where the riot police had to break up a large group of young people because they set off extremely powerful fireworks and ignored police instructions to leave. Initially, the police reported that no one had been arrested, but eventually 14 young people were taken into custody there for fighting, insulting authorities, arson and vandalism.Not all incidents were related to the New Year's Eve celebrations. For example, four people were arrested on the Leliënstein in Rotterdam-Zuid after allegedly shooting a firearm into the air.In a house on the Schoestraat in Spijkenisse, an argument got out of hand towards midnight. A 35-year-old man was stabbed and injured. He was taken to an area hospital. A 58-year-old woman was arrested.A restaurant was shot at in the Oranjeboomstraat in the Feijenoord district, and there were no injuries. In the past year, Rotterdam business premises and homes were more often the target of gunfire and explosions.In several places in The Hague and the surrounding area, the police and riot police units intervened to maintain order. It was not immediately clear how many people were arrested, but arrests were made.The police had to intervene at a bonfire in the Koppelstokstraat in Scheveningen, where a bicycle was swung at several officers to fend them off. The riot police also had to disperse a group of people in Thijssestraat in the Laakkwartier district.In Honselersdijk, the riot police intervened after fireworks were thrown at police officers. At least one person has been arrested there.",Crime1-1-2
