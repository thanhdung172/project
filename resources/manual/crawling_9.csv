First announced at the end of 2021, the service was delayed by about a year.It was originally planned to be a longer route that includes Dresden and Prague. European Sleeper said it anticipates extending their service to those destinations by the end of 2023 or early 2024, the company said on its website. From the start, the train is also expected to stop in Amersfoort and Deventer in the Netherlands, and in Antwerp, Belgium and Hanover, Germany.Ticket sales will get underway on February 20 via the company's website. The Dutch-Belgian startup rail operator has advertised starting prices of 49 euros per seat, and 79 euros for a couchette, with breakfast included.The night trains between Brussels and Berlin will run three times per week at the start, the company said. The company hopes to make it a daily service.The service was delayed mainly because of the difficulties in securing train carriages, and the process of finalizing its timetable. The company said last month that it had hoped to obtain carriages in Russia, but the outbreak of the war in Ukraine made that impossible. Additionally, an extended period of track works is planned for the train line connecting Berlin and Prague. This has put limitations on European Sleeper's ability to run trains on that route due to capacity issues.",Business

Last week, the number of positive tests increased by more than 14 percent. The National Institute of Public Health and the Environment (RIVM) has no clear explanation for this. The institute believes it is too early to tell if this is the beginning of a new wave of Covid-19, preferring to wait for the coming weeks.The RIVM registered 6,744 positive tests in the last seven days, compared to almost 5,900 a week earlier. It is the fastest increase in the number of confirmed infections since the beginning of October, exactly 11 weeks ago.Just before Christmas, the number of positive tests was even higher. Then the weekly total reached almost 7,400, an increase of 26.5 percent on a weekly basis. Last Wednesday, RIVM received nearly 1,400 reports of positive tests in one day, the highest number since early November.The numbers were based on people who have been tested at the official test locations of the GGDs. Self-tests at home were not included in this, so the actual number of infections could be higher.Theoretically, it could be that many people got tested before their Christmas visits and that the increase was due to that. However, other evidence ""suggests that the number of infections is actually increasing,"" according to the institute. For example, the number of virus particles in sewers increased by about 50 percent last week, and also by 50 percent the week before. The number of particles measured roughly tripled in recent weeks.The number of positive self-tests has also increased. On RIVM's Infection Radar platform, people could report when their home self-test indicated an infection, and that number has doubled in just a few weeks.The number of hospitalizations has not yet increased. Last week, 327 people ended up in a nursing unit or intensive care unit because of their Covid-19 symptoms, compared to more than 400 in the weeks before.",Health

The 32-year-old defender terminated his contract in Amsterdam, which ran until the end of this season. Blind played 333 games for Ajax, in which he scored 13 goals.""We have reached an agreement with Daley in recent days to terminate the current contract,"" said Ajax general manager Edwin van der Sar. ""I hope he will continue at another club to finish the last phase of his successful soccer career nicely.""Ajacied. Voor altijd.Bedankt voor alles, Daley! ❌❌❌There is speculation that the 99-time Oranje international could join Antwerp, the club of coach Mark van Bommel and technical director Marc Overmars, in Belgium.It was already announced on Monday that Danny Blind, Daley's father, will not return to the supervisory board of Ajax. Blind senior resigned from that position last year when he took up his post as assistant to national coach Louis van Gaal at Oranje. It was planned that Blind would return to the RVC after the World Cup, but he refrained from doing so.Blind junior lost his regular spot at Ajax this season under coach Alfred Schreuder. However, national coach Louis van Gaal continued to rely on the versatile left-back. Blind was in the starting eleven in all games at the World Cup in Qatar and scored a goal in the game against the United States in the round of 16 (3:1). The Netherlands lost to eventual world champions Argentina on penalties in the quarterfinals.The defender was trained at Ajax and made his first-team debut in late 2008. After a loan spell with FC Groningen in the 2009-2010 season, he won four consecutive league titles with Ajax. Blind moved to Manchester United in the summer of 2014, but returned to Amsterdam four years later. In his second tenure at Ajax, the defender became champion three times and won the KNVB Cup twice. Blind was an important link in the team that nearly reached the Champions League final in 2019.After the departure of coach Erik ten Hag last summer and the arrival of Schreuder, Blind's position was slowly but surely questioned. Schreuder preferred Owen Wijndal at left-back in the final weeks of the first half of the season.""We have agreed with Daley that we will decide together in which game he can say goodbye to the fans in the arena in a nice way,"" van der Sar said.",Sports

This year, for example, more than 600,000 kilograms of illegal fireworks destined for the Dutch market have been seized.""A lot was demanded of police officers"" in the past year and the recovery time was ""much too short,"" Struijs said.

However, Dutch municipalities handle debtors noted as ""lost"" differently. Some conduct this arbitrary measure often, others less frequently or never, reported the newspaper Trouw. The mandatory measure mainly affects people who have not repaid their high amount of social benefits to the municipality. In this process, the affected people are registered by government organizations in the passport warning register of the Ministry of Interior. As a result, the flagged people cannot continue to renew their passports at places that issue passports. The flagged citizens are divided into two groups in the warning register. he first group includes persons suspected of passport fraud, and the second group is composed of persons with outstanding debts of more than 5,000 euros, whose home address cannot be located. The last category includes about 4,000 out of 8,000 citizens recorded in the database in 2021, according to Trouw. However, the way Dutch municipalities deal with citizens whose debts are still outstanding varies. In Tilburg, for example, 66 debtors are affected by the arbitrary measure and will not have their passports renewed. However, this number is disproportionate to Amsterdam, which is four times larger, where only one person cannot renew his passport, wrote the Dutch newspaper. ",Politics
https://nltimes.nl/2022/12/27/gasoline-10-percent-cheaper-beginning-year,Gasoline about 10 percent cheaper than at the beginning of this year,27 December 2022 - 09:45,"The price of gasoline at Dutch pumps will fall by around 10 percent this year, despite the fact that the price rapidly rose to its highest level following the outbreak of war in Ukraine. However, a few days before the turn of the year, it remains inconsistent. When the temporary excise tax reduction expires during the course of next year, prices are likely to rise again significantly.On Monday, the national recommended retail price for a liter of Euro95 was 1,899 euros, according to figures from consumer collective UnitedConsumers. That is significantly lower than the 2,111 euros around New Year's Eve at the beginning of this year. But in March, the price per liter was briefly above 2,50 euros.However, gas station owners can deviate from the price recommendations of the major oil companies. Normally, motorists only pay these prices on the highway. But in order to provide some relief to motorists, the government decided on April 1 to reduce the excise tax. Including VAT, this meant a price drop of more than 20 cents per liter.Later, oil prices worldwide rose again due to the European boycott of Russian oil. As a result, the petrol prices in the Netherlands peaked again at over 2,50 euros in June. As the oil markets calmed down again, gasoline also gradually became cheaper here. This was partly due to expectations that demand for oil in China would decline as a result of slower economic growth there. A recession is now also looming in many Western economies.However, diesel costs more than at the beginning of the year. The average recommended retail price is now 1,892 euros, compared with 1,741 almost 12 months ago. Diesel was sometimes even more expensive than gasoline this year. This was due to the high demand for the substance, which was also in demand in the industry- and transport sector. Experts pointed out that there has been a shortage of diesel fuel in Europe for some time. Until this year, this problem was solved by supplying diesel from Russia, which is no longer possible.
How prices at the pump will continue to develop depends on several factors. For example, it will also depend on whether the major oil states of the oil cartel OPEC want to further reduce their production in order to prop up prices. The reduction in excise duty on fuels in the Netherlands was actually supposed to last until the end of this year.However, the government extended the measure until the middle of next year. After that, the intervention will be phased out. Sooner or later, motorists will have no choice but to pay more taxes again when filling up.",PoliticsBusiness

The dire situation has arisen because there has been a shortage of nurses for years, according to Jongstra.To accommodate all children, extra beds are being added to the existing units. This results in a single nurse being forced to help more patients than desired. Alternatively, ICU nurses are transferred from the adult wards or the neonatal intensive care units where newborn babies receive treatment. ""However, that is not desirable for the patient and also not good for the workload experienced by the nurses,"" Jongstra said.The pediatric ICUs are always fuller in the winter than in other seasons, but this year there seem to be more children with respiratory infections, Jongstra said.

According to an ANP reporter at the location, there were mainly many families and couples who wanted to look at new furniture or find new inspiration. However, the queues at the checkout were not just a result of the crowds, but it was also because not all cash registers were open.

https://nltimes.nl/2022/12/26/interest-rate-hikes-likely-europe-despite-recession-fears-says-dnb-boss,"More interest rate hikes likely in Europe despite recession fears, says DNB boss ",26 December 2022 - 13:10,"The head of the DNB, the Dutch central bank, said the European Central Bank still has a long road ahead in the fight against high inflation, but policy making could be made more difficult by the slowing economy. Earlier this month, the ECB raised interest rates for the fourth consecutive time, increasing the main interest rate by 0.5 percentage points to 2.5 percent, with the deposit rate set at 2 percent. The tighter ECB policy is only just reaching a midway point, suggested DNB leader Klaas Knot.“The risk of us doing too little is still the bigger risk,” Knot told the Financial Times in an interview published on Monday. “We are just at the beginning of the second half.” The ECB has five policy meetings set through July 2023, and Knot predicted that further 0.5 percentage point increases can contribute to addressing the problems currently faced across Europe.The “main challenge,” he told the newspaper, is for policy-makers to determine when they have done enough. The Financial Times noted that as the longest serving ECB governing council member, Knot is the only rate-setter who was also involved in raising rates in 2011. The move was almost immediately criticized, with The New Yorker writing at the time, “ Again, as if on cue, European economic growth stalled and the continent’s debt crisis deepened, which has created problems for markets around the world.”The ECB is now contending with record high annual inflation, with the Netherlands outpacing the eurozone average for most of the year. That seemed to reach a turning point in November when the annual inflation rate fell to 9.9 percent in November, down from 14.3 percent the previous month, and a peak of 17.1 percent in September.The Dutch economy is expected to soon fall into a brief recession, with a minimal amount of growth predicted for 2023. The Netherlands will not be the only country facing a stalled economy: The European Commission said in November it expects most EU countries to fall into a recession by the end of this year, with troubles continuing at least into the spring.Knot said the risks of instability were “much clearer on our radar screen now,” and could have been more cautious about more factors in 2011 instead of focusing heavily on the price of oil that year. Increasing prices across the board, and not just energy prices, are currently Knot’s “main concern.”The Dutch central bank leader believes the ECB could have taken more action even in late 2021, and not only after the war in Ukraine started, however he thought the ECB made up for it with larger rate hikes before shifting down to the half-percent increases seen more recently.Knot is in favor of rate hikes that give the ECB space to see what the effects of tighter policies are on the eurozone as a whole. He also said that it will be difficult getting their message across about the benefit of raising rates when the economy is stalled and member states are staring down a potential recession.A great deal still “depends on the depth of the recession and we have to keep in mind that even if inflation is falling, it is coming off incredible peaks.” He had some optimism for a “short and shallow” recession even with rising wages keeping inflation relatively high for at least two more years.The latest data from Germany suggests that ""the worst may already be behind us,” Knot told the Financial Times.",PoliticsBusiness
