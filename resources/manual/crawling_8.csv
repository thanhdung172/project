The Cabinet member in charge of asylum policy said the Dutch immigration service (IND) can process asylum applications from Russian people and reject them.These Russians no longer have to fear being called up for military operations, the Ministry of Justice and Security stated. This is because the ""Russian Defense Minister has announced that the mobilization has been completed, and instructed the military units to halt mobilization work as of October 31,"" the ministry wrote.Additionally, decisions on asylum applications submitted by Russians conscripts who refuse to serve have been halted for the upcoming half-year. The same was true for Russian conscripts who deserted the military.They may remain in the Netherlands for the time being. This moratorium on asylum decisions and deportation for Russian conscripts was extended by six months by the state secretary on Wednesday.The ministry said it still needed more reliable information about ""to what extent conscripts in Russia were (forcefully) deployed in the war in Ukraine,"" the ministry wrote. Therefore, ""it is not yet possible to carefully decide on the asylum applications of Russian conscripts from 18 to 27 years old.""The moratorium does not apply to professional Russian soldiers who then chose to desert the military. ""The available information about their situation is sufficient for the IND to be able to decide on applications for international protection from this target group,"" the Ministry of Justice and Security said.",Politics

They also believe that differences of opinion on social issues are increasing, according to the latest survey on citizen perspectives from the Netherlands Institute for Social Research (SCP), the government agency that studies social aspects of political policy.Although the Dutch have been concerned about polarization for years, researchers do not see a clear increase in hardened differences of opinion, according to the SCP.In fact, there is more agreement on many subjects than people think and, according to new research, differences in views are not growing. This study also states that two-thirds of the Dutch believe that others can be trusted. At the same time, people think that opinions are expressed in a more extreme and often harsher way, especially in media and social media, and during political debate.People generally, but not always, experience less polarization in their personal lives. Coronavirus is an exception, because it is a subject that affects everyone, according to the SCP. ""Discussions about vaccination have strained relations in many families and friend circles,"" the study said.In general, the Dutch people surveyed think that small groups with loud, harsh voices in particular demand and receive a lot of attention in the public debate. The respondents are particularly annoyed by people with contrarian opinions, such as those who support conspiracy theories, opponents of the coronavirus measures, anti-vaccination proponents, radical right-wing politicians, or groups that express themselves in an anti-democratic or racist manner.Others are annoyed by groups that speak out about climate change, LGBTQ rights, or racism.Two surveys were conducted for this study.

Hospitals are currently treating 813 people who have tested positive for the coronavirus. This is the highest number since October 26, just over two months ago.According to the patient coordination service LCPS, exactly one week ago, 632 people were hospitalized with the coronavirus. This means that in one week, 181 more people were admitted than discharged from the hospital. Furthermore, the total occupancy increased by 111 people just in the single-day period ending on Tuesday afternoon. However, the LCPS figures do not distinguish between people admitted because of Covid-19 symptoms, and those admitted for other health issues who were later found to be infected.Furthermore, hospitals admitted 146 new patients with Covid-19 in recent days. In the last seven days for which data were available, an average of nearly 133 people per day were hospitalized for the coronavirus. This is the highest average influx since late October. But the figures are not updated on Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.In general, the increase in admissions follows the increase in infections. Not only are the official testing sites of the GGD services detecting more Covid-19 cases, but wastewater analysis shows many more coronavirus particles than it did a few weeks ago.

The company failed to deliver enough mail on time in 2019, but claimed this was due to force majeure because it had taken over industry colleague Sandd that same year.However, the court found that the takeover was a ""commercial choice"" by PostNL. The company ultimately ""put itself in the situation"" where it was unable to deliver the mail on time.The fine was imposed on PostNL earlier this year by the Authority for Consumers and Markets (ACM). The regulating authority found that PostNL was not adequately prepared for potential problems at Sandd and that mail delivery had been under pressure for some time.Finally, in the year of the acquisition, PostNL delivered 94,34 percent of its letterbox mail the next day. However, according to the regulations, it should be 95 percent.The court ruling can still be appealed to the Trade and Industry Appeals Tribunal (CBb).

ProRail said that the incident was disrupting service between Nijmegen and Venray. Both Arriva and NS said that the accident forced the cancellation of service between Venlo and Venray, but a replacement bus service was running between the two cities with a stop in Blerick.According to the NS, train service between Venlo and Venray was not likely to be restored until at least 6 p.m. ""Train traffic is currently completely at a standstill and will remain so for the next few hours,"" the Limburg Security Office stated.The intersection where the accident happened is a level crossing where automatic gates and signal lighting was present.

There was more solar energy in particular, but the share of wind energy also increased. The additional generation is equivalent to the total consumption of the provinces of Groningen, Friesland, Drenthe and Overijssel combined.Furthermore, the number of solar panels this year was a quarter higher than last year. There are now 2 million homes equipped with solar panels, compared to 1,5 million last year. One-third of owner-occupied homes and one-sixth of public housing now have solar panels on their roofs. In addition, there were more hours of sunshine, resulting in solar panels generating 40 percent more electricity.Moreover, wind energy grew by 17 percent. There were more wind turbines, but also slightly more wind than in 2021. 41 percent of the energy consumed in the Netherlands is now generated sustainably, compared to last year, when it was only one-third of all electricity.In general, generating energy is not just about electricity, but about all energy consumption, including heat and transport. Electricity currently accounts for 20 percent of energy consumption in the Netherlands, but this share will increase as industry, transport, cooking and heating become increasingly electric.",TechNatureScienceInnovation

In doing so, the judges essentially tossed out the Cabinet's restrictions on allowing the family members to travel to the Netherlands.The Cabinet filed an application for an injunction against the lower court rulings with the Council of State. It initiated this step in anticipation of a planned appeal process, which State Secretary Eric van der Burg for asylum policy already announced on Friday.This concerned refugee status holders who were plaintiffs in four different court cases ruled on last week. Each of the courts ruled that the restriction imposed by the government on family reunification violated the law. As a result, the courts said the family members of the refugee status holders who had gone to court over the issue were allowed to enter the Netherlands. However, the state secretary wants to put a stop to that, according to a letter he wrote to the Tweede Kamer on Tuesday.The refugee advocacy group, VluchtelingenWerk Nederland, said it was not surprised that the Cabinet is seeking legal action to delay the arrival of the family members. ""We have already taken this into account. It's a pity that it had to come like this,"" a spokesperson for the organization said.The administrative law department of the Council of State will decide on the injunction Thursday afternoon or Friday morning, according to a Council of State spokesperson. The Council will issue a full ruling on the Cabinet's appeal in January. No hearing dates have yet been announced.In anticipation of the preliminary injunction, the Council of State decided that Van der Burg did not have to immediately issue entry documents for family members of a Turkish refugee status holder. The Amsterdam court ruled on Friday afternoon that such a temporary residence permit (mvv) for the family members must be issued within 24 hours. This may still be necessary if the Council of State rejects the request for a temporary injunction.The Cabinet decided at the end of August to impose the entry delay on family members of recognized refugees. The Cabinet gave the government a maximum of 15 months to issue visas after the submission of the application for family reunification. However, if the refugee status holder already has housing secured for his or her family members, the visa will be granted earlier. The measure is temporary and intended to last next year as a way of relieving the pressure on the overburdened asylum system, according to the Cabinet.Van der Burg announced on Friday that he would appeal to the Council of State, the highest administrative court, after lower courts again ruled that the entry restriction violated numerous national and international conventions.

https://nltimes.nl/2022/12/28/employees-will-37-percent-salary-next-year,Employees will have 3.7 percent more of their salary next year,28 December 2022 - 11:25,"Employees with an average income will keep 3,7 percent more of their salary next year. Due to changes in tax regulations, they will retain 91 euros more net per month of their gross salary of 3086 euros, as calculated by payroll service provider ADP. People on minimum wage or just above will benefit even more, because the net minimum wage will increase by 218 euros per month.Those earning one and a half times the modal rate, will keep 87 euros more per month. If the salary is twice as high, they will receive 98 euros more net.There are several reasons for the income increases. For most groups, the main reason is higher employment tax credit, which is an amount that is deducted from taxes. In addition, the tax rate decreases a bit and applies to a higher salary.Furthermore, the minimum wage will increase by more than 10 percent due to an additional increase. This affects not only people who earned the minimum wage in 2022, but also those who were just above it. In 2024, the minimum wage will increase again, as the government is no longer referring to a monthly minimum wage, but to a minimum hourly wage. Once this is in place, the government anticipates a 36-hour workweek, whereas the monthly minimum wage currently expects a 40-hour work week.People receiving AOW benefits will also profit by this. Single people will receive 92 euros more per month, while married couples will receive 57 euros more per month twice. However, a supplementary pension of 1,000 euros gross per month hardly brings anything extra. Of this, pensioners keep 2 euros more net per month.In addition, there are other benefits for employees, as ADP pointed out. For example, employers can grant a higher untaxed travel allowance and also more allowances for working from home. The travel allowance will increase from 0,19 to 0,21 cents per kilometer, and the home-work allowance will increase from 2 euros to 2,15 euros per day. This leaves it up to employers to decide whether they want to implement these changes..In general, ADP processes about 1.2 million pay slips in the Netherlands each month. The pay slip processor's figures are in line with data released last week by industry peer Visma Raet. That company only looks at payrolls in the healthcare, education and public sectors.",Business

This is especially a problem at this time of year, when people try making oliebollen, a traditional fried doughy dumpling served on New Year’s Eve.“Oliebollen grease causes major problems in pipes and sewage treatment plants,” the association said. The oil and fat dumped down the drain later solidifies, and can block the waste water system at the home, forcing residents to call a plumber for expensive urgent repairs.The fryer fat can also clog up the sewers or cause problems at sewage treatment plants. “Purifying and disposing of this fat costs the water boards several million euros annually,” the water boards said.The water boards previously told newswire ANP that the problem is compounded by people flushing condoms, feminine hygiene products, and wet wipes down the toilet, which can then clump together with the cooking oil and deep fryer fat to create a major blockage.The association recommends that people recycle their used cooking oil and fats by pouring them into used containers, and dropping them off at collection points.

The newspaper published the interview on Wednesday.
The coalition agreement that led to the formation of the fourth Cabinet under Prime Minister Mark Rutte at the start of 2022 calls for the Netherlands to build about 100,000 new homes per year through 2030. However, the population grew by 191,000 people just in the first nine months of the year, with the final total expected to be around 227,000. ""If the immigration results remain as it stands, 900,000 homes in 2030 will not be enough,” De Jonge said. The housing shortage will only be exacerbated every year the population increase due to immigration is so high even after accounting for emigration, he continued. “The immigration balance must go down.”
A large portion of the population increase this year was due to nearly 318,000 people who settled in the Netherlands between January and the end of September, including 97,000 who fled the war in Ukraine. About 129,000 people left the Netherlands this year, meaning over 98 percent of the population increase this year was driven by immigration.
""We will have to plan our demographics, because, in fact, we are heading for 19 million people in 2034 if nothing changes. We need to form an idea about how many people we can live here with and how much growth can really be accommodated in the Netherlands,"" De Jonge said. The Cabinet needs to get a better handle on the situation, whether immigration is linked to asylum, love, family reunification, or international students, the minister said. Without a comprehensive approach, politicians end up putting too much of the burden on society as a whole.
“And then we undermine support for immigration in a country where we will also need immigration. But the current growth in the number of people in our country is potentially disruptive.""
The problem is not new, and as a whole, successive governments have thus far “failed people” when it comes to handling the housing shortage over the years, the minister said. “We have let it get to the point where the shortage of suitable housing affects people’s livelihoods.”
The minister noted that over 20 years ago he was able to purchase his first home in Carnisse for 64,000 guilders, but his children will not be in as positive a position when they reach their mid-twenties in 2030. “I was blissfully happy. You can no longer buy a garage for that money.”",Politics

It's busy there, but manageable. That's according to the University Medical Center Groningen (UMCG) after a consultation between university hospitals on Tuesday. Chairman Károly Illy of the Dutch pediatric association confirmed the outcome.One of the reasons for the high hospital utilization is the RS virus, a respiratory infection that circulates every year during the cold months. Adults can catch a bad cold from the virus, but it can cause severe shortness of breath in babies. Furthermore, the flu epidemic also contributes to the crowds in hospitals.The Netherlands has seven pediatric intensive care units (ICU), which are part of the university hospitals. According to UMCG, it can handle the crowds because of good cooperation with general hospitals. For example, a child who has recovered sufficiently can be transferred from the ICU to a nursing unit in a regular hospital.The Groningen teaching hospital sometimes transfers 16- and 17-year-olds to adult intensive care units. ""That provides extra breathing room,"" a spokesperson said. But some scheduled surgeries, such as organ transplants, may be postponed.",Health
