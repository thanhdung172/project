https://nltimes.nl/2023/01/04/alleged-drug-lord-plotted-kidnapping-dutch-pm-rutte-witness-claims,"Alleged drug lord plotted kidnapping of Dutch PM Rutte, witness claims",4 January 2023 - 09:27,"The potential threat that prompted an increase of security around Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte was connected to the investigation into the assassination of journalist Peter R. de Vries. Shortly after the murder, a confidant of the person accused of orchestrating the attack told police that the same group was targeting Rutte, according to a report published Wednesday by Nu.nl. The same witness also linked both plots to Ridouan Taghi, the alleged drug lord wanted by Dutch police for years until his arrest in Dubai at the end of 2019.The witness, nicknamed Eddy, spoke at length with police about Krystian M. The Polish man was 27 years old when he was arrested this past July in the De Vries case. M. was already in jail at the time, awaiting trial in a separate case where he and others allegedly stole cars to be used in assassinations and other violent crimes. That case also has links to Taghi’s family.Eddy reported to police in 2021 with information about the De Vries murder, which took place two months earlier. According to Nu.nl, his witness statement reads that M. had told Eddy about his client in the murder, whom he referred to as “uncle.” Though the man’s name was never revealed, Eddy said that “uncle” was described as the man behind the murder of Nabil B.’s lawyer, Derk Wiersum, and B.’s brother. B. is the key witness in the case against Taghi and his associates regarding multiple assassinations and attempted homicides. De Vries was also assisting B.’s legal team.In his interviews with police, Eddy said that M. also confided in him that the same “uncle” also “wanted to kidnap the prime minister.” Around that same time, Rutte’s security detail was increased substantially. The prime minister reportedly argued at length over the need to visibly step up his protection.This happened after suspicious people were seen observing Rutte’s movements in detail. Authorities referred to them as “spotters.” Spotters were also seen in the vicinity of Peter R. de Vries before he was gunned down in Amsterdam. The spotters observing Rutte had ties to organized crime, Nu.nl reported.It was not immediately clear if “Eddy” is the same person as “Witness 5089.” RTL Nieuws previously reported that the witness came forward out of concern for his and his family’s safety. He also stated that M. referred to his client as his “uncle,” and that M. was “looking for someone who would shoot a journalist” with the contract killing valued at 100,000 euros.A year later, in September 2022, Rutte’s security detail was increased again. The security around Princess Amalia, the oldest daughter of King Willem-Alexander, was also increased to the point she was forced to abandon her plans to attend the University of Amsterdam in-person. She has mostly remained at her parent’s home since then. A month later, Rutte stated that one of his fourth Cabinet’s goals was to “cut off the head of organized crime.”Taghi has not formally been implicated in the murder of Peter R. de Vries. His attorney, Inez Weski, has denied all rumors and allegations linking him to the case. She also said her client was in no way tied to alleged plots targeting Rutte and Princess Amalia.The trial against the first two men arrested in the De Vries case was ordered to start over shortly before a verdict was to be announced. That was due to the arrest of M. and several other suspects, as well as new testimony. A hearing meant to provide an update in that criminal case around the assassination is set for Friday.",CrimePolitics

The warning was issued by the Dutch meteorological institute, KNMI, for Noord-Holland and Friesland, as well as the Wadden Islands and the area around the IJsselmeer.“Strong gusts of wind up to approximately 80 km/h are possible in the northwest of the country,” the KNMI wrote. The wind out of the southwest can affect traffic as well as outdoor activities. “The heavy wind gusts can last until the end of the morning.”The sustained wind speed can range from from 50 to 62 km/h in Noord-Holland, and about 40 to 50 km/h in Zuid-Holland, Zeeland and Friesland. The wind is expected to be even stronger at the coast, at sea, and along the IJsselmeer shore. Inland, sustained wind should hold below 40 km/h.The wind will remain strong in the afternoon but will start to die down, remaining a bit calmer at least on Thursday. It could pick back up on Friday and Sunday, especially in the northwest, the KNMI said. There is a very high chance of rain each of the next six days.The high temperature was predicted to be about 12 degrees for the rest of the work week, and a little cooler over the weekend, with lows ranging from 6-8 degrees.

FNV believes that the gap between the lowest and highest earners in a company should be narrowed.The union has been calling for a minimum 14 euro hourly wage for quite some time. The increase on January 1 put the minimum wage at 11 euros per hour based on a 38-hour work week.FNV ranked the Shell CEO among its most influential executives.

The company does not yet intend on stopping the sponsorship of Formula 1 driver Max Verstappen, a Jumbo spokesperson confirmed after the story was reported by newspaper AD.Jumbo's sponsorship of motorsport was discredited light last year due to the investigation by the Public Prosecution Service (OM) into Jumbo CEO Frits van Eerd. He was arrested in September as a suspect in a money laundering case. The OM previously said that the money laundering was carried out through real estate transactions, the automotive trade, and sponsorship in motocross.Ton van Veen, who is temporarily heading up the company, emphasized earlier in the day that the OM's investigation still is not focusing on Jumbo itself. The company nevertheless commissioned an independent investigation into the sponsorship activities. This investigation has now been completed and, according to Jumbo, no criminal offenses or irregularities within the group have emerged.It is not clear what Jumbo's decision to say goodbye to motorsport means for athletes who have been supported up until now. Jumbo's spokesperson did not want to give any additional explanation when asked. She also could not say why Jumbo is turning its back on those sports..Jumbo is very active in the sports world as a sponsor, including with Verstappen, who is the two-time Formula 1 world champion. Jumbo also sponsors a combined skating and cycling team, Jumbo-Visma, motocross rider Jeffrey Herlings, and various motorsports teams, football clubs and billiards tournaments.The supermarket chain also released an annual report on Tuesday, saying it planned to again invest heavily in the Belgian market. ""We are going to open around ten new stores there,"" Van Veen said. The company opened 27 branches in Belgium over the past few years.The Belgium market comprised of over 200 million euros out of Jumbo's total turnover, which exceeded 10 billion euros last year. Revenue in Belgium doubled last year alone.The negative publicity surrounding Frits van Eerd, who stepped down as a suspect in the major money laundering case, had no influence on income. ""Reputationally, it affected us. On the other hand, we see that our customers have remained overwhelmingly loyal"" said Van Veen.It is unclear what will happen to Van Eerd, who temporarily stepped down during the money laundering case. ""Frits as a person is still a suspect, we have to wait and see what comes out of the investigation."" Whether Van Eerd will ever return to Jumbo is still unknown. ""Still too early to say anything about that,"" he said.",CrimeBusinessSports

SOS Dolfijn announced this based on observations reported to the marine mammal nonprofit organization. No images from Tuesday are available yet, but the nature organization said that the observations that have been passed on to them fit the description of a humpback whale.A humpback whale was spotted last week off the Belgian coast near Ostend. According to SOS Dolfijn, it could very well be that this animal traveled up the coastline, because ""for a humpback whale that is only a very small"" distance.It appears to be an adult specimen. They can reach an average length of about fifteen meters. Humpback whales can manage very well in the North Sea, according to SOS Dolfijn. ""It's probably just looking for food."" For the time being it seems to be a healthy animal and there is therefore ""no cause for concern.""Humpback whales fall under the category of baleen whales and feed by taking a large mouthful of water including the fish and then filtering it. In recent years, the mammals have been seen on average once a year in the North Sea. Last June, a dead humpback whale that was extremely emaciated washed ashore on Vlieland.SOS Dolphin said that people can easily watch the animal from the beach.

The group said a collaborative effort led to the stunt, which made use of a laser projector. Police previously said they believed the words were projected from a boat.One of the statements, often referred to as ""14 Words,"" was popularized by American neo-Nazi David Lane, and read, ""We must secure the existence of our people and a future for White children."" Another was ""White Lives Matter,"" a reaction to the Black Lives Matter movement first popularized by an American white supremacist organization. Advocates say the statement attempts to pretend like racism does not exist in society.The OM said that the use of discriminatory hate speech was evident, ""based on the context in which the statements were made, and their coherence."" Prosecutors went on to note the importance of freedom of speech as a fundamental right in the Netherlands. ""But there are limits to that freedom of expression. One of those limits is that expressions may never incite discrimination or offend another segment of the population.""The statements were clearly visible by people on the quay near the bridge attending the national New Year's event organized in Rotterdam.

Another message was “Zwarte Piet deed niets verkeerd,” which translates to “Zwarte Piet did nothing wrong.” That statement refers to Zwarte Piet, a holiday character often portrayed by white actors in blackface makeup.Prosecutors asked people witnesses to contact the police if they saw anything suspicious, such as how the messages were projected on the bridge.stond er nou white lives matter op de erasmusbrug..... #Rotterdam pic.twitter.com/81zPcJWfg5",Crime

Techleap.nl Special Envoy Prince Constantijn also said that the show is a way to see how people react to the ideas brought forward by start-ups. In addition, international contacts can easily be established there.The Dutch companies that go to the show are very diverse. AgXeed, based in Oirlo in the northern region of Limburg, makes autonomous agricultural vehicles. Amsterdam-based CarbonX developed a more sustainable carbon material for tires. Søvn from Utrecht has made a wearable in-ear device that detects and helps reduce teeth grinding and clenching.There are also software companies that use artificial intelligence, for example, to prevent food waste, such as WasteWatchers and Orbisk from Utrecht and the Enschede company OneThird. Software developed by Whispp, from Leiden, helps to convert speech whispered by people with damage to their vocal cords into their natural voice.Furthermore, Lightyear is an eye-catcher.

https://nltimes.nl/2023/01/03/covid-hospitalizations-jumped-60-last-week-2022-hospital-total-8-week-high,Covid hospitalizations jumped 60% in last week of 2022; Hospital total at 8-week high,3 January 2023 - 17:12,"A total of 623 people infected with the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus entered hospital care in the Netherlands during the final calendar week of 2022, according to the RIVM. The number of new hospitalizations rose by nearly 60 percent compared to the previous week, the Dutch public health institute said on Tuesday in its regular weekly update on the situation. Figures from the RIVM showed that 63 of patients admitted last week were sent to an intensive care unit, up from 42 the previous week.Out of the 623 admissions, 527 were first taken to the hospital due to the severity of Covid-19 symptoms. The other 96 people were initially admitted for other reasons.Hospitals were treating 819 patients with Covid-19 on Tuesday afternoon, the most at one time since November 8. The patient total has been steadily rising since dipping to a low point of 460 on December 14, according to data from patient coordination service LCPS.During the seven-day period ending on Tuesday, the LCPS said hospitals were admitting an average of 145 new coronavirus patients daily. That reflects a smaller 8 percent increase, though the LCPS reported a more significant increase the week prior. The organization's data is typically different from the RIVM, as their criteria, time period analyzed, and data collection methods are not the same.Despite the overall increase in hospitalizations, the percentage of people reporting symptoms of Covid-19 fell a bit. Some 6.7 percent of people surveyed by the RIVM during the last calendar week of 2022 said they had symptoms of the coronavirus disease, down from 7.3 percent the previous week. More recently, 1.8 percent of surveyed respondents tested positive for the viral infection, up slightly from 1.7 percent. That includes people who self-reported the results of a self-test kit.Officially, 6,245 people tested positive for the coronavirus infection since last Tuesday morning. That was 500 fewer than the previous week, the RIVM said. Those figures only include people who tested positive at a GGD facility or other authorized locations. Just 5,404 coronavirus tests were completed at the GGD during the last calendar week, down from 7,891 the week before.Sewage surveillance did show an increase in coronavirus particles of over 31 percent during the week ending on Christmas Day. That is the continuation of a trend which started over a month ago.The basic reproduction (R) number fell significantly in mid-December, from 1.04 to 0.86. That means that 100 people contagious with the coronavirus on December 20 likely infected 86 others, who then went spread the virus to 74 more people. They then gave the coronavirus to 64 people. When the figure is below 1.00, it indicates a likelihood that fewer people will be infected with the virus on a week-to-week basis.",Health

Several efforts were made in vain to find the loot in the Gelderland village, but it was never recovered. The treasure is believed to be worth millions, and is linked to August 1944. ""During the defense of Arnhem, there was an explosion at a branch of the Rotterdamsche Bank on the Velperweg. German soldiers put loot in their coats at the scene,"" said Annet Waalkens of the National Archives in an interview with Omroep Gelderland.It is believed that watches, jewels, cut and polished diamonds, and jewelry were swiped by the Nazi soldiers. The rumor is that the loot was placed in ammunition boxes which were buried in Ommeren. The Dutch state even brought a Nazi officer back to the Netherlands to try and find it, but the items were never recovered during those efforts.The stolen items may have been found by treasure seekers, or at random, and never announced to the public. They may also have been collected by the Nazis days after the items were stolen.The treasure map is just one of hundreds of pages being made available on Tuesday. All told, the collection of the National Archives includes 142 kilometers of paper archives, and 1.2 petabytes of digital files. There are 15 million photos in all and 300 thousand maps, reported newswire ANP.Documents assembled by A.M. van Tuyll van Serooskerken will also be released from the time he chaired a committee investigating abuse in internment camps that were used to house Dutch people suspected of collaborating with the German occupiers during the War. “The archive contains harrowing stories of torture, humiliation and revenge against this group of 'illicit Dutch people'. Leg irons used to chain detainees together, sometimes for weeks, are tangible evidence of the often inhumane conditions in these post-War camps.”The National Archives will also publish personal files from the Ministry of War’s Intelligence Bureau, as well as files related to the former Dutch East Indies and Indonesia’s struggle for independence during the War. “There are files about the resistance against the Japanese occupation, about conscientious objectors and deserters, and a conspiracy against Captain Westerling,” the National Archives said.Meetings from the Council of Ministers, which generally meets weekly, will be published from the year 1997. “The Netherlands was EU president in that year, and the climate conference was held in Kyoto. Swine fever was circulating throughout the Netherlands, and there was unrest among farmers about the planned substantial reduction in livestock numbers,” the National Archives notes.“The expansion of NATO with a number of Eastern European countries was a hot topic on the agenda. Especially when it comes to relations with Russia,” the National Archives said. Additionally, refugee and asylum seeker issues were still hot button topics 15 years ago. The minutes also show how the Cabinet at the time struggled with its relationship with Suriname when balanced against extradition requests for Desi Bouterse.",PoliticsTechScience

The figure was compiled by Smart Traffic Accident Reporting, or STAR, which works with statistics and research provided by several organizations, including government agencies, the police, and travel association ANWB.Citing STAR's figures, the Telegraaf reported 491 traffic fatalities in 2021, and 496 in 2020. Before the coronavirus pandemic began, which kept more people off the roads, there were 522 traffic fatalities in 2019 and 534 in 2018.However, figures provided by Statistics Netherlands (CBS), show traffic fatalities to be higher every single year. For example, in 2021, the organization counted 582 cases, and an average of 638 in each of the five years prior. The CBS only explicitly says it does not include cases of murder, manslaughter, and suicide, where STAR says it does not count any cases of intent at all in its data.Additionally, the total number of deaths in 2022 traffic accidents can still rise higher this month. Both STAR and the CBS define a traffic fatality as someone who dies at the scene of a crash, or within 30 days from injuries caused by a traffic accident. STAR does not count cases of suicide, illness, or incidents that are intentional in its figures.Not only did the number of fatalities rise to a record high, the number of road accidents in which at least one person was injured rose to 21,457, over 3,500 higher than the year before. The number of accidents with only material damage also increased by 10,028 compared to 2021, rising to 75,025. That reflects a 15 percent increase, according to STAR data.A victim is defined by STAR as any “driver passenger or pedestrian who is injured or dies in a traffic accident.” They do not factor into account the severity of injury.In an interview with ANP, Paul Broer said figures suggesting that injuries and fatalities surpassed totals from the pre-coronavirus years highlight a ""worrying trend."" Broer handles the approach to traffic enforcement at the national division of the police. He said speeding, distracted driving caused by phone calls, and driving under the influence are three of the five most common causes of accidents.He also called on local and provincial governments to prioritize certain road safety issues, like lighting, but also making sure infrastructure can handle all of the different types of bicycles, including electric, fat bikes, and cargo bikes.",Crime1-1-2

If that test is positive, they must be isolated and not allowed to fly. ""We believe that our people should be protected,"" said Brama.Reinier Castelein agrees. He is the chair of labor union De Unie. ""People have those concerns. For example, KLM employees who do not feel safe because they also provide care for family members.""

""We need a broad European approach for this. It's about time, because otherwise you won't get anywhere with it.""KLM said that the safety of crew and passengers is of paramount importance. The company said it follows the guidelines issued by the government. On flights from China, passengers and crew are required to wear a face mask during the flight.

Many police forces reported that supervision of the ban was mainly a matter for civilian street enforcement teams in different municipalities and that the high volume of emergency calls meant police only acted in fireworks cases in the most excessive situations.Fireworks were not allowed this past weekend in 12 different municipalities. That number is expected to rise over the year, according to the Association of Dutch Municipalities (VNG). As long as there are no national regulations, ""many more municipalities are guaranteed to follow with a local ban,"" a VNG spokesperson said. Some 65 percent of the municipalities said in a survey earlier this year that they were in favor of a ban.According to the police in the east of the Netherlands, it was ""very quiet"" during the turn of the new year and there was no reason to hand out fines. The police spokesperson even claimed that hardly any fireworks were set off in Nijmegen, Apeldoorn and Heumen, the three municipalities in the district with a fireworks ban.But the mayors of Nijmegen and Apeldoorn did not agree with the police assessment. They claimed that there were many fireworks set off despite the ban.The Rotterdam area police said that the ban was not enforced in Rotterdam and Schiedam. ""This was a symbolic move; they knew that it could not be enforced. We only did that in case of excesses,"" said a police spokesperson.This decision also applied in Amsterdam, Haarlem, Bloemendaal and Heemstede. Enforcement took place when fireworks were thrown at police officers, emergency workers, or other people. A spokesperson for the Noord-Holland police district said this also included when people put themselves in harm's way.In Amsterdam, efforts were made to take action where possible, according to a spokesperson. ""But it was busy, so we had to make choices.""Just like the police in Amsterdam, the police unit for the central region of the Netherlands could not say whether fines were issued where a ban applied, in Soest and in Heuvelrug, Utrecht. ""But we didn't go looking specifically because we had other things to do.""In Limburg, the police also did not issue fines between December 28 and January 2 for violating the fireworks ban in Mook and Middelaar. That also was not actively enforced, according to a spokesperson. ""The priority was not there.""",CrimePolitics

The statements included ""We must secure the existence of our people and a future for White children.” The statement is known as “14 Words,” and was popularized by comments made by American neo-Nazi David Lane, who died in prison in 2007.Other statements shown on the bridge included, “Vrolijk Blank 2023 - Happy White 2023,” and “Zwarte Piet deed niets verkeerd,” which translates to “Zwarte Piet did nothing wrong,” a reference to the winter holiday character often portrayed by a white actor in blackface makeup. ""White Lives Matter"" was also projected on the bridge, a saying first promoted by a white supremacist group in Texas in response to the black Lives Matter movement.""The action can lead to feelings of insecurity for many Rotterdam residents,"" Radar said. ""'White lives matter' or 'Zwarte Piet did nothing wrong' are not neutral statements but play down discrimination and racism in society. Instead of listening to people who experience racism, empathizing with them and reflecting on your own position, you avoid dialogue and ignore the fact that racism exists.""The organization pointed out, ""All lives matter, but Black people and people of color are more likely to be disadvantaged or victimized – for example, by police brutality. The Black Lives Matter message therefore emphasizes that black lives also matter.""Hoe is het mogelijk dat tijdens de jaarwisseling racistische teksten op de Erasmusbrug in Rotterdam konden worden geprojecteerd? #Rotterdam #racisme #burgemeester pic.twitter.com/lXlWvxNydpOn New Year's Day, police said they were still investigating the incident. “As we now estimate, the images were projected from a boat.

It is rather sloppy,"" a spokesperson said at the time.Alderman Ronald Buijt, who is also the deputy mayor of the city, said to RTL Nieuws, “I found the slogans projected on the bridge tonight to be rude and polarizing.

A spokesperson confirmed the change of plans after it was reported by Luchtvaartnieuws.""Our priority now is not a New Year's reception, it is our operations,"" she said. It is believed to be the first time that Schiphol Airport will have skipped its New Year's gathering, with the exception of the past two years, which was due to the coronavirus restrictions.Major problems arose at Schiphol last spring, summer, and part of the autumn due to shortages of security guards and baggage handling personnel. Waiting times became enormous and security checkpoints, and many people missed their flights as a result.Interim CEO Ruud Sondag said last month that Schiphol lost control of many aspects of its business because so much of the organization was outsourced. ""The operational agenda has faded into the background in recent years,"" Sondag said. ""You lose knowledge and control"" as a result of offering contracts to companies which tender bids.The airport is trying to attract new security guards through a major recruitment campaign. Schiphol expects it still needs hundreds of new security guards ahead of this year's upcoming summer season.Travelers at Schiphol again complained about long queues on Monday morning. According to a spokesperson, this was due to a shortage of security staff.He said the waiting time was generally at a maximum of between 45 minutes and an hour. However, the crowds were not nearly as bad as last summer, he claimed.",BusinessCultureEntertainment
