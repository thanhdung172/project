https://nltimes.nl/2022/12/24/netherlands-ranks-32-list-best-cuisines-world,The Netherlands ranks 32 on the list of the best cuisines in the world,24 December 2022 - 12:55,"At the end of the year, the TasteAtlas, known as a culinary guide to international cuisine has compiled a list of the Best Cuisines in the World, ranked online by audience votes. There, the Netherlands took 32nd place out of 95, beating Austria, the Mecca of pastries and cakes, which came in 33rd behind the home of the Stroopwafel.Still, the Netherlands couldn't beat Belgium (31st), or even the United Kingdom (29th), which is known more for its changing prime ministers lately than its fine cuisine. Italy, Greece, Spain, Japan and India rounded out the top five, while Iceland, Canada, Latvia, Morocco and Norway were ranked 90 through 95. The ranking also clarified once and for all among food enthusiasts that Parmigiano beats Gouda. However, it is surprising that the Netherlands with its ""traditional cuisine"" made it to 32nd place of the world's top 95 cuisines, as not a single Dutch dish was mentioned on the list of ""100 best traditional dishes in the world in 2022."" It begs the question, for what exactly the Dutch cuisine earned its 32nd place?According to TasteAtlas, the audience voted mainly for two culinary ""taste poles"" of the Dutch, namely cheese and sweet-fatty foods. These included the old classics such as Old Amsterdam cheese, stroopwafels, pancakes and mini-pancakes, specifically pannenkoeken and poffertjes, which were among the top rated Dutch foods. Nonnevot, Hollandse Geitenkaas, a type of goat cheese, were also popular along with traditional Gouda cheese, and suikerbrood, a sweet delight from Friesland.In the category ""Best rated Street food in the World,"" the ever-popular poffertjes were ranked 97th out of 100. The small, round pancakes just barely made the list, beating out the popular Polish potato pancakes ""placki ziemniaczane.”Traditionally, poffertjes are topped with melted butter and powdered sugar, and are said to have originated in a Dutch Abbey. There, they were used as a type of communion host, becoming increasingly popular among churchgoers until they found their place as a sweet snack among the Dutch.Roti calai from Malaysia was the most popular street food, followed by karaage from Japan, and guotie, the pan-fried dumplings from China. In fourth place Are espetos, a type of grilled sardine from Spain, followed by tacos and carnitas from Mexico in fifth and sixth place.The doughy brown sugar Limburg treat, Nonnevot, ranked high on the list of the 50 Best Rated Fried Dough Foods in the World. Dating back centuries, the regional specialty came in at tenth, narrowly beaten by Hungarian Langos. Picarones, a Peruvian ringed doughnut drizzled in cane sugar syrup, took the top spot.Oliebollen, often compared to doughnuts or fritters, came in at 28th on the list. Particularly popular leading up to New Year’s Eve, the balls of dough are fried, and served with powdered sugar. They were pipped in the rankings by Portuguese Malasadas, but just barely beat Melbourne, Australia’s hot jam donuts.According to TasteAtlas, among the most popular dutch dishes are the kroket at number one, followed by the appeltaart, the Dutch style of apple pie. In third place, the audience voted for another sweet delicacy, namely the stroopwafel, followed by the hangover dish, kapsalon. Poffertjes landed in fifth place.TASTEATLAS AWARDS 2022: BEST CUISINESDon't hate us, we just count the ratings. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯https://t.co/PAGoI6vU2T",CultureFood

The programs serve as a supplementary benefit in addition to government subsidies and social benefits, reported NOS. The aim of this measure was not only to support low-income and the poorest families, but also people in the lower-middle income range, who were also affected by the current economic situation in the Netherlands. Among the 60 programs, different target groups and additional needs were covered. For example, pet owners in Amsterdam were eligible for free veterinary visits. Residents of Echt-Susteren, Limburg, receive a birthday voucher, and in the Zuid-Holland town Zwijndrecht, families were provided 75 euros in dressing allowance per child. In addition, AOW affected people in Capelle aan den IJssel were able to use public transportation for free, according to NOS.Also this year, the municipalities have invested a lot of money in social assistance, even more than in the previous year, because more people had to take advantage of the assistance due to the high inflation and the consequences of the energy crisis. Above all, income support measures were provided by more than 50 Dutch municipalities, which used an income standard in allocating the energy subsidy of 1300 euros, which was more flexible than the usual 120 percent of the social assistance standard, wrote NOS. However, the regulations differ by municipality. Accordingly, the amount and the possibility of income support depend on where people live in the Netherlands. ",Politics

The new unit will now also focus on personal security of ministers, judges, public prosecutors and lawyers. The extended protection came about because the Marechaussee was under pressure as more and more people needed to be secured.
This is because threats from terrorist circles, which the Marechaussee say have always existed, were joined by threats from criminal circles, they told KMarMagazine. In addition, increasing unrest in society, for example in connection with Covid-19 and the farmers protests, and a general hardening in society also play a role. Furthermore, the unit can also be deployed abroad if necessary.Currently, the Royal and Diplomatic Security Service of the National Police is still mainly responsible for personal protection at home. The first group of this new unit will begin training in January and will consist of members of the military police themselves. The goal is to train a total of five classes in 2024 and 2025.For this purpose, the Ministry of Justice and Security has earmarked millions of euros for the National Police, the Public Prosecution Service, the NCTV and the Marechaussee to further strengthen the Surveillance and Security system.",Politics

For the first time, the limit of 2200 hours of sunshine per year was exceeded. The total number of sunshine hours, including the forecast for the last days of the year, is expected to reach about 2230. The old record dates back to 2003 and was 2099.5 hours. On average, the sun shone for 1773 hours nationwide.It was also the first time that the sun shone for at least 2,000 hours across the country.

https://nltimes.nl/2022/12/24/self-employed-people-can-benefit-greatly-new-pension-law-says-knab-bank,"Self-employed people can benefit greatly from new pension law, says Knab Bank",24 December 2022 - 08:15,"The pension system overhaul that passed the Tweede Kamer on Thursday night may prove to be highly advantageous for self-employed people and freelancers working in the Netherlands. A wide majority in the Tweede Kamer supported the law, which is meant to modernize the country’s pension system by making it more flexible and more accessible to all adults from the age of 18, while making it easier to accrue a pension almost immediately when starting work.The law will almost certainly help the 1.2 million people who are registered as self-employed with the Dutch Chamber of Commerce. If the bill passes the Eerste Kamer, the upper House of Parliament, it will mean self-employed people can put more money into their personal pension holdings every year with more tax advantages.Self-employed people will be able to earmark a maximum of 30 percent of their profits before paying income tax into their pension. Currently, they can put 13.3 percent of the money earned annually into their pension without paying income tax on the contribution.It means that those whose income place them in the upper tax brackets can contribute 10,000 euros into their pension, but will effectively pay 5,050 euros net to do so because of the tax breaks received, said Oskar Barendse from Knab Bank. “It doesn’t get any cheaper than that. The only condition is that you invest in a third pillar product, like pension savings, investments, or annuity insurance,” he said.Additionally, Barendse noted that pension funds will be able to take on self-employed people with no employees as clients when the new law passes the Eerste Kamer and takes effect in the Netherlands. Already, about a third of self-employed people are expected to save with a pension fund if they gain access to them, Barendse said based on internal research from Knab. “Whether this is wise is highly questionable. Much is still unclear about this part of the plan, as such a fund is often more expensive than if you yourself invest in a pension savings account, for example.”The Tweede Kamer spent dozens of hours debating the complex bill in the run-up to the vote, including separate votes on dozens of amendments earlier in the week. The bill creates a foundation for a new way of handling the national pension assets of about 1.5 trillion euros, which will no longer be handled collectively, but in more individual funds.The new system is meant to be more protective of how people engage in work now, which is often more flexible and changing over the course of a career than in the past. At the same time, the new system may introduce more risk.The ruling coalition parties voted in favor of the law in a roll call vote in the Tweede Kamer, along with left-wing opposition parties GroenLinks and PvdA. Although SGP and Volt also signed on, the left-wing parties will be critical in winning passage in the Eerste Kamer, where the coalition does not have a majority.The composition of the Eerste Kamer will also change next year as it is determined by the results of the provincial elections in May. For that reason, the Cabinet will want to see the bill taken up more quickly after the Christmas and New Year’s recess. Three of the parties in the coalition, VVD, D66 and CDA, are polling much worse now than just after the last Tweede Kamer election in March 2021.",PoliticsBusiness

These complaints usually pass after a few days. Every year, 153 million people worldwide get such a mild infection with salmonella.The link between more serious forms of salmonella, such as the variant that causes typhoid, and an increased risk of cancer had already been demonstrated, the researchers explained. But several mild infections, which people hardly notice, can also contribute to the development of cancer. Repeated mild infections makes it more likely that bacteria can enter and manipulate cells.""We also found that several mild infections increased the growth rate of these intestinal tumors,"" said Jacque Neefjes, a professor of chemical immunology at Leiden University.It is difficult to completely avoid salmonella infections because they are common in livestock and food, explained Professor Jun Sun from the University of Illinois Chicago.

In 2021, museums attracted 12.3 million visitors, a fall of more than 2 million than a year earlier, the Central Bureau of Statistics (CBS) calculated. Compared to 2019, when Covid-19 first appeared in December, attendance was down 64 percent.Museums were closed for months in most cases due to pandemic restrictions at the beginning and end of 2021. Even when the institutions were allowed to welcome visitors again, measures such as a maximum number of visitors per square meter were in place. Some museums, in the meantime, participated in a trial of COVID-19 Rapid Antigen Tests that allowed them to open earlier, but that involved only a handful of institutions, CBS said.The biggest decline was seen last year among museum-goers from abroad. Whereas in 2019 there were still 10.3 million, in 2021 it was 1.5 million foreign visitors, a drop of more than 85 percent. CBS noted that since the Covid-19 pandemic outbreak, fewer elderly and disabled people have visited museums.As a result of the drop in visitors, museums again suffered significant losses in audience revenue. Last year's total was nearly 99 million, a drop of more than 60 percent compared to 2019. Thanks to government support, most museums ended their fiscal year in the black, according to CBS. In 2021, funding measures totaled more than 145 million euros, in addition to 156 million euros in donations and other private money.

The Cabinet decided on this measure at the end of August. With the appeal, the Cabinet wants a final decision on whether or not the scheme is legally tenable.This month, several courts ruled in five cases to allow people recognized refugees to bring their family members to the Netherlands. The refugees in those cases include a Syrian woman, a Turkish man and an Iraqi woman. Each and every one of the court rulings stated that the government measure to limit the family reunification of refugees is illegal. According to the judges, the regulation is in violation of both national and international treaties, including the European Convention on Human RightsAfter the first ruling at the beginning of December, State Secretary Eric Van der Burg, who is responsible for the policy, maintained the restriction on travel in connection with family members of recognized refugees. He said the preliminary relief judge had not ruled on the family reunification order as a whole, but on a specific case.After a verdict handed down Thursday, Van der Burg said that he would not rule out an appeal to the Council of State. After studying the five judgments published this month, the Cabinet decided on Friday to appeal to the Council of State in order to obtain clarity from the highest administrative court about the restriction on travel in connection with family reunification.The restriction on family reunification applies to family members of people who are already in the Netherlands. The Cabinet decided at the end of August that a visa will be issued up to fifteen months after the application for family reunification has been submitted.However, if the status holder manages to secure a home for his or her relatives traveling in the Netherlands, the visa may be issued earlier. The measure applies up to and including 2023 and, according to the Cabinet, is necessary to relieve the pressure on the overburdened asylum reception system.",Politics

This can help stem the loss of purchasing power due to high energy prices, he said on the news program Nieuwsuur.Knot said he made some calculations that showed wages could increase by 5 to 7 percent. He stressed, however, that this is an average. It is not the case that companies in all sectors are doing equally well and have the same room to maneuver everywhere. In fact, some sectors are actually suffering greatly from high energy prices. ""But there are also sectors that are showing record profitability, such as trade and manufacturing.”DNB already published new economic estimates earlier this week. These showed that the labor market will remain extremely tight for the time being, with unemployment rising only slightly. This means that the need for personnel will continue in many sectors. DNB Chief Economist Olaf Sleijpen also believed that there is still room for additional wage increases in many sectors.
That is not to say, however, that employers should fully compensate for inflation with the wages they pay. DNB has been warning for some time that automatic wage indexation - something that unions, for example, would like to see - is not a good idea, because that could actually boost inflation even higher.
In that case there would be a so-called wage-price spiral, in which people would spend considerably more and thus encourage companies to raise their prices further. For now, DNB does not yet have the impression that such a scenario is imminent.",Business
