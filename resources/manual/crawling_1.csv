https://nltimes.nl/2023/01/07/voice-holland-scandal-reports-transgressive-behavior,After The Voice of Holland scandal more reports of transgressive behavior,7 January 2023 - 17:00,"Following reports of alleged abuse at The Voice of Holland, confidential advisers received an increasing number of reports of abusive behavior. This is according to an internal survey conducted by the National Association of Shop Stewards (LVV) on behalf of the newspaper AD. More than half of the respondents said they had noticed an increase of transgressive behavior.Two-thirds of the complaints were filed by employees. In slightly less than half of the cases, a supervisor was the one who displayed the undesirable behavior; in a quarter of the cases, it was a colleague. Furthermore, most of the cases involved harassment (over 56 percent), followed by sexual harassment (11 percent).Of the 173 LVV members who responded to the survey, 89 percent said awareness of cross-border behavior in the workplace has increased in the past year. For instance, people were more likely to be addressed about transgressive behavior, most confidants said. In addition, some respondents said there is less kissing and cuddling, such as at birthdays or Christmas and New Year's celebrations. People also no longer dare to make ""inappropriate jokes.""Alleged abuses behind the scenes of the tv program The Voice of Holland were exposed last January by the program BOOS. Shortly after the publication of the sexual transgressive behavior at the RTL 4 program, 19 women spoke about misconduct by band leader Jeroen Rietbergen, 15 about a director, and two women filed charges against coach Ali B. However, after a year, the victims are disappointed after the Voice scandal, as they still have to wait for results of the investigaton of the law firm Van Doorne and of the Public Prosecution Office (OM). “Waiting for clarity is exhausting,” said Sébas Diekstra to AD, the lawyer who assists victims. “It is painful and frustrating that there is now only one case left that is directly related to The Voice.”This concerns former The Voice contestant Nienke Wijnhoven, who filed sexual misconduct charges twice. The charges were against band leader Jeroen Rietbergen and director Martijn N. However, the charges against the director were dropped in November, causing frustration among the victims.Reporting by ANP and NL Times",CrimeCultureEntertainment
https://nltimes.nl/2023/01/07/dutch-iranians-protest-hague-news-execution-iran,Dutch Iranians protest in The Hague after news of execution in Iran,7 January 2023 - 16:00,"The Association of Iranian Academics in the Netherlands organized a demonstration in front of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in The Hague on Saturday afternoon after Iran executed two men on Saturday morning.The two men (20 and 22 years old) were hanged for their involvement in the killing of a soldier during a demonstration in the country, according to Iranian authorities. With these executions, the regime has now handed down a total of four death sentences, according to the Reuters news agency. Three other people were also sentenced to death in the case, and 11 others were sent to prison. Organizers of the protests are calling on the Netherlands and the European Union to take tougher action against the regime in Iran. ""They are becoming more and more brazen,"" the organizers said. They expect about 100 to 120 participants at the demonstration.Mass demonstrations for more freedom and against the Tehran regime have been taking place in Iran since mid-September. The wave of protests is the largest in Iran in years and started after the death of 22-year-old Mahsa Amini. She died in custody after being arrested by the morality police for allegedly wearing her headscarf too loosely.Meanwhile, thousands of people have been arrested in the protests in Iran. Several have already been sentenced to death. According to the organization Iran Human Rights Watch, hundreds of protesters have been killed by Iranian security forces.",Politics

""All passengers have now been rebooked. They will fly back on Sunday at the latest,"" a KLM spokesperson said, according to De Telegraaf.
On Wednesday, a KLM plane in Singapore was unable to depart for the Netherlands. Due to a technical defect, the flight was postponed by one day. 400 passengers then had to spend the night in the Asian city-state.Some of the passengers were vacationers returning from Bali, as the plane was coming from there. The plane was supposed to make only a short stopover in Singapore. According to KLM, the passengers were accommodated in hotels later on.However, the repair of the plane took longer than originally planned, so everyone was stuck in Singapore a little longer. ""The safety of passengers and crew was not at risk,"" the KLM spokesperson stressed.The plane in question, however, is still in Singapore. It is currently unclear when the plane will be repaired and able to depart for Amsterdam again.The KLM spokesperson also responded on Saturday to the new Dutch rules for travelers coming to the Netherlands from China. They will need a negative coronavirus test starting next Tuesday. ""We will of course comply with the applicable laws and regulations of the Netherlands and the countries we fly to,"" the spokesperson explained.At the moment, China is battling a major Corona outbreak. Other European countries have also already taken action in response. However, KLM is not required by the government to check for test certificates itself when boarding in China, but the airline must inform passengers that a test is mandatory and what the consequences may be if the test is not negative. The actual check takes place at Schiphol Airport.",Business

The Netherlands and the United Kingdom are joint initiators of the meeting, which aims to provide practical and financial support to the International Criminal Court (ICC) in investigating and prosecuting war crimes in Ukraine.The organizers of the event are British Deputy Prime Minister Dominic Raab and Dutch Minister of Justice and Security Dilan Yeşilgöz. ""The reports and images of Russia's illegal and unprovoked armed attack on Ukraine are horrific,"" Yeşilgöz said in a statement. ""For us, it is clear: these crimes must not go unpunished.""Raab added that ""Russian forces must know that they cannot act with impunity, and we will support Ukraine until justice is served.”In addition, Chief Prosecutor of the Criminal Court Karim Khan will brief ministers on the ICC's work. At the moment, prosecutors continue to gather evidence of atrocities and sexual violence in recaptured areas of Ukraine.The meeting at Lancaster House comes at a time when Russia is stepping up its campaign of terror against Ukraine, attacking key energy infrastructure and plunging people into the darkness and cold of winter, the British government statement said. ""Nearly a year on from the illegal invasion, the international community must do all it can to support the International Criminal Court to hold war criminals accountable for the atrocities we are witnessing."" The ministers will also discuss how to help victims and witnesses give their testimonies without causing them further suffering.Last year, the Netherlands sent two forensic teams under the banner of the ICC to Ukraine to collect evidence. Two new missions are planned for this year. The Netherlands also supports the ICC, based in The Hague, with financial assistance and personnel.",Politics
https://nltimes.nl/2023/01/07/less-fireworks-damage-dutch-municipalities-last-year,Less fireworks damage in Dutch municipalities than last year,7 January 2023 - 13:30,"This past New Year's Eve, significantly fewer trash cans, lampposts, benches and other municipal property were damaged than the year before. And this was despite the fact that in most places people were allowed to set off fireworks themselves for the first time in years. That's the first impression from an ANP tour of about 160 of the 342 municipalities in the Netherlands.So far, about 90 municipalities have assessed the damage. In total, almost 1 million euros worth of damage was caused there last New Year's Eve. In the same municipalities last year, the bill was almost 1.5 million euros. In about 20 municipalities however, there was more damage than in the previous year, and costs decreased in more than 50 municipalities.About 60 municipalities are still in the process of assessing the damage and therefore cannot yet provide information on the amount of damage. Among them are cities such as Rotterdam (350,000 euros in damage last year) and The Hague (465,000 euros last year). Damage is also still being assessed in cities such as Utrecht, Eindhoven, Breda, Nijmegen, Apeldoorn, Haarlem, Enschede, Zwolle, Zoetermeer, Leiden and Delft.Overall, Amsterdam has the highest costs at the moment. In the Dutch capital, damage amounted to 217,400 euros. According to the municipality, 66 garbage cans, 43 container pits, 23 underground and 12 above-ground containers, 15 parking meters, 25 bus shelters, 41 traffic signs, two street signs and a bench were damaged. However, this is less than last year, when the damage amounted to more than 260,000 euros.In Hellendoorn in the province of Overijssel, the damage almost doubled from 14,500 euros to 28,500 euros.""Especially the replacement of complete playground equipment is a big expense,"" the municipality informed. In the neighboring municipality of Rijssen-Holten, the bill also rose from nearly 12,500 euros to more than 27,000 euros. In addition, Zutphen now has a damage of almost 30,000 euros, compared to over 20,000 euros last year.Pijnacker-Nootdorp, however, saw the biggest drop in spending. The municipality of Zuid-Holland had one of the highest bills in the country last year, after the major cities. The damage at that time amounted to 64,475 euros. But the price now dropped to 19,500 euros. The fact that the damage was so high last year was due to vandals destroying a sports park. Fences, dugouts, an artificial turf pitch and playground equipment were vandalized and had to be replaced.Also Nunspeet (from 45,000 to 4,000 euros), Oss (from 60,260 to 25,703 euros) and Dordrecht (from 51,600 to 19,600 euros) now have significantly less damage to repair. In Staphorst, damage on New Year's Eve amounted to just 500 euros. ""Apart from a single traffic sign, nothing was destroyed,"" according to the city council. A year earlier, Staphorst saw damage of 20,000 euros throughout December. According to the municipality, this month was troubled ""because of the coronavirus and the ban on fireworks"".Roosendaal, however, did not assess the damage. A spokesperson for the municipality of Brabant explained, ""It is a misconception to expect a municipality to check all traffic signs, wastebaskets, bus shelters, playgrounds, and other street furniture for damage on New Year's Eve, only to conduct another check on New Year's Day. This is not a realistic expectation. Any amount mentioned would be debatable.”",PoliticsCultureLifestyle

The group became active in the Lijnmarkt located restaurant because the french delicacy foie gras was on the menu there.The activists began what they call a ""playful occupation"" around 7 p.m. and refused to leave the restaurant until foie gras was off the menu. Foie gras is the fatty liver of ducks or geese. These animals are fattened through a funnel or tube over a short period of time, a practice that is banned in the Netherlands.As a result, six activists were arrested for refusing to leave the restaurant. Two of them chained themselves and had to be freed by the police. One activist however, was arrested because he could not identify himself.During the action, a guest of the restaurant injured his leg. He slipped on leaflets handed out by activists and subsequently had to be taken to hospital. The campaign ended around 9:30 p.m., police reported.",CrimeCultureFood
https://nltimes.nl/2023/01/07/flevoland-tried-coordinate-buyout-farmers-schiphol,Flevoland tried to coordinate the buyout of farmers with Schiphol,7 January 2023 - 11:50,"Flevoland Province may be guilty of forming a procurement cartel. The alleged attempt to form a cartel stems from documents the province itself posted online under the Open Government Act (WOO), as well as from conversations the broadcasting company NOS had with several legal experts on the subject.The province wanted to coordinate with Schiphol on which farms of farmers would be best suited for buyout so that more freed-up nitrogen space would be available. This allows the price to be negotiated down in the agreements, but this is not permitted. However, a provincial official wrote the NOS in an email that “farmers may be negotiating with multiple nitrogen buyers, driving up the price. These are market forces, and you can't always do anything about them, but it may make sense to coordinate on this.""
According to legal experts the broadcast company interviewed, however, the province is not allowed to interfere in the operational affairs of farmers. This is because farmers who want to (re-)sell their farms in the future would no longer have a fair market to do so. Pieter Kuypers, a professor at Radboud University, also told NOS that this supposed coordination regarding nitrogen rights makes the province a business, and therefore subject to competition law. But ""coordination between parties is prohibited under competition law,"" Kuypers said. The reason for Schiphol Airport's strong interest in the nitrogen space is due to the delayed opening of Lelystad Airport. At the moment, no air traffic can take place there, because the airport has problems with the nitrogen permit. However, with the buyout of the farms, Schiphol can use the nitrogen space that these farmers have used, and thus get a permit for their ghost airport, according to NOS.",PoliticsBusiness

As a result, the more than 18,000 employees covered by the collective agreement, such as distribution center workers and truck drivers, will receive pay increases of up to 9.5 percent in several steps. The lowest pay grades will see the biggest increase. PostNL staff will also receive a one-time payment of 1.5 percent of their gross pay next month.In addition, the travel allowance for commuting will be raised in two steps to 22 cents per kilometer, and the pension contribution paid by employees will not be increased until March 2024. Agreements have also been reached on early retirement and reduced working hours for older employees, and there will be special leave for people undergoing gender reassignment.As recently as December, BVPP and CNV had taken action. This led to a new invitation from PostNL to negotiate, BVPP said. Members of the two trade unions have not yet commented on the agreement reached. However, PostNL expects them to vote for or against this agreement in two weeks at the latest.The FNV was outraged because it was not invited to the collective bargaining. ""This attempt to reach agreements without the largest union is another insult to our own employees,"" said FNV board member Mariska Exalto. ""FNV was not invited to these talks and had to find out in a roundabout way what agreements were reached. It's a bizarre way to sideline your own employees. It just doesn't seem to sink in that this method of working ultimately causes more unrest than is desirable.""The union did not present the new final offer to its members because, according to the elected active members, the final offer was inadequate and was not negotiated with FNV. The union had previously walked away from the bargaining table but could not take action until this week due to a court ruling.",Business

However, the planned robbery failed, and eventually police managed to arrest them after a long chase. German police said Friday evening that the suspects were between 20 and 32 years old.The three Dutchmen detonated explosive devices at an ATM near a campsite in the municipality of Wietzendorf, between Hamburg and Hanover. However, the ATM remained undamaged despite the explosion, so the perpetrators had to flee empty-handed.After the explosion, German officers saw a suspicious car driving at high speed towards the border with the Netherlands. The flight ended near the village of Thuine, almost 200 kilometers from Wietzendorf and just across the border near Enschede. The police there placed a ""stop stick"" on the road, puncturing the tires. All four tires of the car were damaged as a result and the occupants were unable to continue driving and surrendered. Furthermore, explosives were found in the car.Many explosive attacks have been committed in Germany in recent years, often perpetrated by so-called plofkrakers, which are organized gangs from major Dutch cities, trying to open ATMs through explosive attacks. After the explosion, they usually flee in fast vehicles. To avoid falling into the hands of the police, the plofkrakers sometimes take many risks.

KLM said it was still working on a response.KLM employees previously expressed concerns about the large coronavirus wave in China. According to Brama, it is particularly important that these tests allow better monitoring of other Covid-19 variants. ""In this way, we can get a better picture of China,"" she said. Brama also advocated testing aircraft wastewater from China for virus particles, as is being done in Belgium. ""That would be a good option,"" she explained.Earlier this week, KLM announced the immediate introduction of additional safety measures on flights from China. Staff will be equipped with FFP2 face masks and will be able to use an employee-only restroom. Furthermore, the Dutch Airline is also adjusting in-flight service on flights from China to Amsterdam. This should reduce the number of lengthy contacts with passengers. For example, passengers will receive their food and drinks at the same time rather than in multiple rounds. Also, headphones and water bottles will no longer be handed out, but placed on seats in advance.KLM now flies to China three times a week, and from the end of this month it will be six times a week. On flights from China, passengers and crew were already required to wear a face mask during the flight. Chinese carriers such as China Airlines, China Southern Airlines and Xiamen Airlines also fly to Schiphol Airport.In response to Kuipers' decision, Schiphol Airport said that all government regulations and advice would be followed. Travelers from China must also show a negative coronavirus test in other European countries. Self-tests were previously offered at Schiphol for passengers from China.

The Nazi soldiers had reportedly buried jewelry, precious stones, gold watches and coins in ammunition boxes after finding them in Arnhem. Back then, the valuables had been blown out of the safe in an Arnhem bank during the violent war.The reason for this was that this week the National Archives unveiled a real treasure map showing the location marked with a cross, which immediately received a great deal of media attention. According to the website of the municipality of Buren, of which Ommeren is a part, it received ""many inquiries about this treasure map and the Nazi treasure"" and now feels compelled to warn treasure hunters of dangers and prohibitions.""Experts point out that the area is near the front line of World War II. Searching there is dangerous because of possible unexploded bombs, land mines or shells. Therefore, we do not advise searching for the Nazi treasure,"" the municipality of Buren stressed. In addition, It is also ""prohibited to use or have with you a metal detector or any other object for detecting metal objects in public without an exemption from the mayor and aldermen"", the municipality continued.However, it is unlikely that anything will be found. After the war, several frantic but unsuccessful searches were made for the treasures, also with detectors in the wider area. The original source of the story, a furniture maker from Baden-Baden who was active in Velp as a parachutist for the German army, was still involved in 1947 to give the Dutch authorities instructions. But the efforts were in vain. The question is now, whether his story was a fabrication or whether others dug up the treasures.",Politics

This was reported by several mosque umbrella associations, including the Stichting Platform Islamitische Organisaties Rijnmond (SPIOR). The mosque umbrella organizations considered the reflection on undercover investigations a thing of the past for now.In late 2021, the newspaper NRC wrote, based on its own research, that several municipalities had secretly commissioned investigations of the Muslim community. This included collecting sensitive information, such as on mosque administrators and imams. The National Coordinator for Counterterrorism and Security (NCTV) reportedly paid for it and allegedly chose the agency in charge of the investigation.The mosque umbrella association SPIOR stated that over the past 14 months there have been discussions between the government and various Islamic organizations about ""these excessive spying activities and the major breach of trust that has taken place."" During these talks, it was reported that the Islamic organizations are now demanding full access to the documents and a guarantee that nothing like this will ever happen again. Furthermore, they also demanded an apology. ""Once these (demands) are met, there will be room again to start the conversation and work toward a new, constructive relationship between the government and the community.""The mosque umbrella organizations also mentioned that they already came up with a work plan earlier. They found it ""strange"" that they have now been invited again for a reflection meeting and called for ""concrete measures to restore the breach of trust that has occurred."" Therefore, they are more interested in a meeting in a few months, they wrote, at which they can look back on ""first steps"" that must then have been taken by the government in response to the work plan.However, the Ministry of Social Affairs and Employment had not yet responded to the cancellation of the meeting on Thursday evening.",Politics

The care home said this was necessary due to food waste and because the budget had to be kept in mind, according to a letter from the facility to its residents, which Hart voor Delft published on their website.At the end of December, the residents received a letter about the provision of meals and ""adjustments with the least possible impact."" The adjustments already started with the first dish. ""While you still get soup seven days a week, from 1 January 2023 you will receive a broth four days a week and a soup three days a week. The soups will also be vegetarian more often,"" was stated in the letter.Die Buytenweye stated that until last year, more food was provided than the “norm” and therefore food was ""often"" thrown away. That is why from now on, standards ""based on the Dutch average for nursing homes"" will be applied, and that ""should be more than enough."" These include 150 grams of potatoes, 150 grams of vegetables and 80 to 100 grams of meat or fish per resident per day, the facility's team leader reported. From now on, staff serving the food will be equipped with scales.Residents with a big appetite however, can ask if there is any food left, according to the facility. Furthermore, staff and volunteers""in principle"" can no longer eat with the residents, unless there is something left over that would otherwise disappear in the trash can.However, Hart voor Delft found it ""absolutely unacceptable"" that ""our old people"" are treated this way. ""Will nursing homes from now on become a kind of food bank?"" they asked. As a result, the party will submit written questions to the relevant city council. Cuts in care are not permissible, certainly not on food, which cannot just be obligatory vegetarian, said Hart voor Delft. ""As for the volunteers, these kinds of cuts are not really motivating.”Healthcare provider Pieter van Foreest, to which the Buytenweye belongs, has not yet responded to a request for comment on the allegations.The seniors' association ANBO has also never heard of a nursing home restricting food for residents in this way. ""And we hope it stays that way because that's the last thing you should do,"" the spokesperson said.According to the ANBO, the hot meal is also the highlight of the day for many residents, and we should allow them to have that in the last years of their lives. ""Otherwise you will lose quality of life.""Tackling waste is fine, the association said, but it shouldn't be the case that people with a bigger appetite have to constantly ask if they can get anything else on their plate. ""They might also start to feel guilty,"" a spokesperson explained. Individual adjustments are easy because in such a facility it is known who eats more and who eats less, according to ANBO.",PoliticsBusiness

Health Minister Ernst Kuipers decided to order the restriction after other European member states had already taken similar measures. China is in the midst of a major coronavirus outbreak after it recently lifted most of its Covid-19 restrictions.The Netherlands has also issued urgent advice to wear a medical face mask on board flights to and from China. More testing of the sewage water at Schiphol Airport will also be conducted to monitor the situation.Kuipers had asked the Eerste Kamer, the upper house of Parliament, to come back from recess so that the senators could urgently deal with a law that would allow the minister to continue to take such measures. But the Senate unanimously decided that Kuipers was putting pressure on the senators, and that an accelerated handling of the law should not be considered. Kuipers wrote in a letter sent on Friday to the Tweede Kamer, the lower house of Parliament, that he will now instruct the Kennemerland Security Region to enact the measures, also on behalf of Justice Minister Dilan Yesilgöz. Current law already allows for the situation to be handled in this way. Schiphol Airport is located in that security region. The Netherlands has 25 such regions.Kuipers had asked the Outbreak Management Team (OMT) and the Social Impact Team (MIT) for advice before announcing the restriction. According to the OMT, it is preferable that measures are aligned across Europe.However, there is not believed to be an additional threat to the Netherlands, because the population is largely believed to have a built-up immunity against the Omicron variant of the virus. According to research, most Chinese coronavirus patients are infected with some form of Omicron.The MIT thinks that the social impact of the new measure will be limited, because the measure has no effect on cargo transport.

However, more people were arrested: 771 arrests against an average of 709 over the past four years.This was reported by the police on Friday in its report on the New Year's holiday. The police mainly noted a decrease in fireworks incidents (-51.7 percent), vandalism (-33.5 percent) and nuisance (-19.2 percent). Police could not say to what extent to which the decrease was the result of the police deployment. ""The rainy weather during the first half of the evening may also have played a role,"" said Peije de Meij, New Year's Eve coordinator at the police.""We have also kept a record amount of prohibited fireworks off the street through intensive investigation,"" said De Meij. ""Where things threatened to get out of hand, rapid intervention succeeded in many cases in removing the fuse from the powder keg. Massive public order disturbances were prevented, partly because of this.""The 771 arrests were mainly for public order incidents, such as public drunkenness or nuisance in hospitality districts, and driving under the influence. The police called this increase ""explainable"", since the catering industry was closed in the past two years due to coronavirus measures.In the end, 161 people were reported to the Public Prosecution Service for crimes committed during the turn of the year. That is a decrease of 15 percent compared to 2021, when there were 190 suspects. Most cases involve violence against aid workers, other people or property. Eleven cases involved fireworks.""I can't possibly look back with a satisfied feeling,"" said De Meij about the busiest evening of the year for the police. ""I've seen too much misery and too much violence against aid workers for that."" A total of 155 officers were confronted with violence, for example because they were pelted with heavy fireworks. This led to injuries and hearing damage. In The Hague, more than ten police officers had to go to hospital during the turn of the year.""We saw a slight decrease in suspects when it comes to violence against aid workers.

It was so crowded that not everyone could fit into the auditorium. Many watched on screens in the coffee rooms, and some still had to stand outside.Family members wore red, the color of love. The pastor called it “bizarre to have to say goodbye to an entire family.” He said it was “inconceivable, incomprehensible.”The director of Rinaigela’s school also spoke. “A chair is missing in group 4,” he said. “Always a child short. We will miss your bright smile.”The funeral ended with Bob Marley’s song Three Little Birds, assuring the attendees that “every little thing is gonna be alright,” followed by cheerful hip-hop music. A brass band escorted the three coffins to a bier at the end of the funeral service. Rinold, Michelle, and Rinaigela were buried at De Ommering cemetery.

https://nltimes.nl/2023/01/06/circus-acrobat-suffers-broken-ribs-pelvis-fall-wheel-death,"Circus acrobat suffers broken ribs, pelvis in fall from Wheel of Death",6 January 2023 - 13:00,"The 26-year-old circus acrobat who fell from a great height during a performance by the Kerstcircus Haarlem on Wednesday broke several ribs, and his pelvis, a spokesperson for the circus said to AD. The acrobat and several other artists were performing in the Wheel of Death when the accident happened at around 8:45 p.m. on Wednesday. The Wheel of Death consists of spinning wheels in which multiple acrobats can show off their skills. The man lost his balance during the downward movement and fell “three to four meters” to the ground. Because the wheel was already moving downwards, he fell with extra speed, the spokesperson said. About a thousand spectators, including many children, saw the accident happen. The circus made help available to spectators who needed it. “Among the thousand spectators, there were also a lot of children who saw this person fall,” a police spokesperson said to AD. “This is very intense to see, so from the police, we advise people to contact the doctor if they get complaints after this. Victim Support is also available.”The Christmas circus has been in the Burgemeester Reinaldapark in Haarlem-Oost since December 22. Performances are scheduled up to and including January 8. The circus will open as usual, but the Wheel of Death will not form part of the act until the investigation shows what went wrong. ",1-1-2CultureEntertainment
