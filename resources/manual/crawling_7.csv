https://nltimes.nl/2022/12/30/wind-threatens-cancel-new-years-national-fireworks-show,Wind threatens to cancel New Year's National Fireworks show,30 December 2022 - 13:05,"The company that will set off the National Fireworks show at the Erasmus Bridge in Rotterdam during the turn of the new year is concerned about the wind forecast for Saturday evening. According to Jolanda Pen of Dream Fireworks, it is not allowed to set off fireworks if the wind force is above level five on the Beaufort Scale, or roughly 39 kilometers per hour. ""It's getting somewhat tense.""Weeronline predicts a strong wind out of the southwest with strong to stormy winds at the coast measuring between wind force 7-8, or 50-75 km/h, with heavy gusts. In other municipalities where the company organizes fireworks shows, things will also be cut short, Pen believes.These include the two other locations of the National Fireworks program, in Hoek van Holland and the Nesselande district of Rotterdam.There are also concerns about the continuation of shows in Amsterdam, at the Hofvijver in The Hague and at three locations in Hilversum, including the National Countdown Moment. The decision ultimately rests with the province, according to Pen. ""It will be very sad if it doesn't happen.""At the moment, the wind is blowing at nine meters per second, reports a spokesperson for the DCMR Environmental Service Rijnmond. That converts to about 32 km/h, landing at wind force five. The event would be able to continue if conditions remain the same as they are on Friday afternoon. A number of checks will be carried out on Friday, and two inspectors will be available all day on New Year's Eve.Ultimately, the inspectors of the DCMR, the mayor and the organization of the National Fireworks will decide whether the fireworks showcase can continue, said the spokesperson.",CultureEntertainment
https://nltimes.nl/2022/12/30/dutch-consumers-transferred-record-amount-via-tikkie-2022,Dutch consumers transferred a record amount via Tikkie in 2022,30 December 2022 - 11:50,"People in the Netherlands transferred a record amount of money in 2022 using the payment service Tikkie. According to ABN AMRO, the bank behind the service for mobile payments, 130 million payments were sent using Tikkie valued at a combined total of 5.5 billion euros.With that, 2022 leaves the previous record from last year far behind. People then paid 4.2 billion euros via over 100 million tikkies. A Tikkie is often sent to settle expenses between a group of people, such as for dinners or drinks, so the hospitality industry restrictions during much of 2021 in response to the coronavirus pandemic likely explains some of the difference. “I think that will be a part of it. It is true that Tikkies are usually food or drink related,” said Moreno Kensmil, head of marketing for Tikkie, about the difference from last year. During coronavirus lockdowns, there was a dip seen in the number of mobile payments being sent, although the decrease was limited, he claimed. “But this year we saw more payments were being made with the opening of the catering industry, and also Carnival and festivals that were allowed again.”Alongside the end of the coronavirus crisis, Kensmil added that more and more users are joining the payment service. Also, the average payment was higher this year by several euros. The highest number of Tikkies sent in a single day happened on Friday, November 25. Almost 530,000 Tikkies were paid that day, where about 350,000 are sent on an average day. That day the Netherlands men’s football team played against Ecuador at the FIFA World Cup. It was also Black Friday, a day which originated in the United States but has taken a place in Dutch consumerism, with shops giving discounts before the holiday season. It is mainly residents that use Tikkie for sending payment request, yet more companies are using the service. Compared to last year, the number of business users rose by a quarter to 25,000, which led to introduction of a business version of the service. The speed at which people pay is a possible benefit. Almost nine out of the ten Tikkies are paid within a day, and over six out of ten are paid within an hour. ",TechCultureLifestyle

The court in Ghent ordered the woman, Romy W., to remain in custody for the time being.W. has been jailed for almost a year. She was arrested in January, after the 4-year-old Flemish boy was found dead a few days earlier at Neeltje Jans in Zeeland. Dean was staying with W. and her boyfriend, Dave De K., in Sint-Gillis-Waas, Belgium, when he was last seen alive.W. was arrested on suspicion of murder and kidnapping, but it is still not clear whether the Dutch woman had an active part in boy’s death. She has previously said she is innocent.De K. is still considered the primary suspect in the case.According to Dean's mother, the Dutch woman lied to her at the time when the mother asked about the whereabouts of her son. The couple was asked to babysit the boy for a period of time, but had not brought the child back to the mother as expected.De K. had left for the Netherlands with Dean during that time. The police believe there is a strong possibility that Dean was already killed in Belgium before De K. brought him to the Netherlands.",Crime
https://nltimes.nl/2022/12/30/record-breaking-high-temperatures-strong-winds-expected-new-years,Record-breaking high temperatures and strong winds expected on New Year’s,30 December 2022 - 10:02,"Residents of the Netherlands may have noticed this week that they have not had to make heavy use of heating systems in their homes, like earlier this month. The country could potentially break the national record for the warmest New Year’s Eve and New Year’s Day, with Dutch meteorological institute KNMI predicting a high of 15 degrees Celsius on Saturday and 14 degrees on Sunday. However, strong winds could hamper celebrations, with a Code Yellow Weather Warning in effect for some provinces on New Year’s Eve.National records are measured in De Bilt, Utrecht, home to the KNMI. The centrally located municipality is considered the country’s meteorological average.The New Year’s Eve record is 14.1 degrees set on December 31, 2021, with the New Year’s Day record set a day later at 13.2 degrees. The latter broke the previous record of 12.9 degrees in 2012, followed by 12.4 degrees in 1921. The coldest temperature on record for a New Year’s Day was -7.3 degrees set in 1997.Friday is expected to be marked by periods of rain, with most of the country facing stronger winds from the south. The wind will be particularly powerful along the North Sea coast and the IJsselmeer area, sustaining at about 39-49 kilometers per hour. The northwestern coast could at times see storm force gusts of up to 74 km/h later in the afternoon. The temperature should range from about 8 degrees in the north to 10 degrees in the central region, 11 degrees in Zeeland and up to 12 degrees in Limburg.It is in the southeastern province where the temperature could even range up to 16-17 degrees on New Year’s Eve. Most of the rest of the country should see the thermometer reach about 15 degrees, though the northern provinces will be a bit chillier at 13 degrees.During the evening, New Year’s revelers can expect rain at first, especially in the central and northern region, the KNMI said. “Over the course of the evening it will become more dry in the south, then in more and more places. At the end of the evening, the chance of some rain increases again in the west.”The winds will continue to be strong out of the southwest, and may be problematic around the turn of the new year, with gusts reaching up to 80 km/h in the northern coastal areas. A Code Yellow Weather Warning related to powerful winds was issued for 6 p.m. to midnight on New Year’s Eve in Noord-Holland, Friesland, and the Wadden Island area.The persistent wind will be felt throughout the country. However, gusts and sustained wind should die down a bit on New Year’s Day.Sunday will again see some soggy weather, but not as much as on Saturday. The first days of the new year will see “periods of rain and very high temperatures” compared to the average. “Tuesday will be the driest, then rain will fall from time to time and it will remain mild.”This will lead to more variable weather during the second week of January, but a continued high probability of above average temperatures both during the daytime and at night. “There is a small chance (approx. 20%) of drier and colder weather,” the KNMI said.",TechNature
https://nltimes.nl/2022/12/30/director-gender-equality-institute-fired-sexual-misconduct-hostile-workplace-claims,"Director of gender equality institute fired over sexual misconduct, hostile workplace claims",30 December 2022 - 09:23,"The head of an institute that helps promote safe workspaces for people employed in the Netherlands was herself fired over allegations that she fostered a hostile work environment at the institute’s Amsterdam headquarters, according to a report published in the Volkskrant. The newspaper cited conclusions from an internal investigation to report that Kaouthar Darmoni was dismissed as the head of Atria. The institute states on its website that it promotes “gender equality and women’s history” that also “examines the current position of women in society and provides advice for future policy.”Darmoni was accused of “transgressive and intimidating behavior” that was sometimes sexual in nature, and targeted her subordinates. The internal investigation also found that she deleted criticism from a staff survey to conceal results from the supervisory board, and made false statements regarding her education and work experience.Darmoni said her termination was unjustified, and based on “a collection of fabrications.” She plans to file a lawsuit challenging her dismissal, the newspaper said.Darmoni took over as director of the organization in October 2019. Many of the accusations current and former Atria staff members made against her date back to 2020. The investigation was launched in July 2022 by Hoffmann Bedrifsrecherche, an external firm organizations can hire to study their internal workings. The director was described by former employees as an “uninhibited” exhibitionist who on occasion would strip down to “her bra or her thong” in the open office space, the Volkskrant reported. They detailed how Darmoni allegedly kissed people without permission on their heads, or would grind against them during mandatory dance sessions.They described that she started weekly meetings by forcing workers to participate in belly dancing. “Most of us thought that was terrible. Sometimes Kaouthar pressed her breasts or buttocks against you while dancing. If someone said something about her behavior, she would laugh at you squarely,” said one worker who went by the name of Nicky.Anyone who complained about Darmoni’s antics would be bullied or ridiculed, the investigation found. “If you fell out of favor with Kaouthar, you ended up before the tribunal,"" said one worker identified by the name of Charlie. “She would turn other colleagues against you or start yelling at you in front of everyone. We had a constant fear: ‘Who is going to be next?’”To enforce the hostile work environment, another employee claimed Darmoni placed security cameras that could record both video and audio around the institute’s office in Amsterdam Centrum. The cameras were not necessarily used for their stated purpose of preventing theft or vandalism. An employee named Sam claimed that workers were often asked to account for issues recorded by the cameras. “This was repeatedly reported because it violates privacy laws. But nothing was ever done about it,” Sam told Volkskrant.In another instance, the investigation into Darmoni found that she deleted statements pleading for help by about half of Atria’s workers who participated in an employee survey. These messages were not reviewed by the organization’s supervisory board as a result. Mistruths about her background, including statements about her education and prior work experience, were the result of “deceit and/or error,” according to the final report on the investigation, Volkskrant reported.Darmoni would not comment about the claims former workers made in conversations with the newspaper. She also said she has not read the final report about the internal investigation, but she did review the questions asked by investigators, which she said were meant to lead people to paint the wrong picture about her. “The opinion of employees who are positive and have objected to the insinuating question posed by the researchers has not been included.”The newspaper did note that in a previous interview with the Volkskrant’s weekly magazine supplement, Darmoni said, “Even before the pandemic broke out, I was sometimes warned: be careful with touching, it is transgressive behavior. Some women at Atria found it a bit scary at first, but then they loved it.”Atria’s supervisory board would not respond substantively to questions from the newspaper about the investigation, calling it an ongoing legal matter that involved mediation between Atria and its former director. An in email to current and former staff obtained by the Volkskrant, they wrote that they regretted the “unsafe work situation” went unaddressed for as long as it did. “Although the Supervisory Board was also fooled by Ms. Darmoni for many months and even from the outset, the Supervisory Board regrets that the supervisory system did not function properly on several occasions.”The statement was not enough for the former workers who spoke to the newspaper, who said the organization is trying to prevent as much publicity about the issue as possible. “I understand that the Supervisory Board wants to safeguard Atria's reputation and the subsidy from [the Ministry of Education, Culture and Science]. That is also important, because many people are doing good work there. But if you keep Kaouthar's misbehavior quiet, she will soon be in a high position somewhere else and making victims there too.”",PoliticsBusiness
https://nltimes.nl/2022/12/30/four-times-many-young-people-arrested-weapons-2019,Four times as many young people arrested with weapons as in 2019,30 December 2022 - 08:28,"The police arrested 1,268 young people up to the age of 18 this year for illegal possession of weapons, a sharp increase compared to four years ago, according to the police. In 2019, there were 315 minors arrested for similar crimes. The police are concerned about the fact that more and more young people are being arrested for the illegal possession of weapons.The number of knives and other stabbing weapons seized rose from 33 to 355 in the past four years. In 2019, the police confiscated 27 firearms from young people, a figure which soared to 144. The police said that it is difficult to identify the actual number of firearms young people possess based on these figures.Possession of prohibited fireworks is also included in the overall figure. In 2022, more than 50 percent of the illegal possession of weapons among young people involved fireworks. That share is decreasing: in 2019 the rate was still 74 percent.Martin Sitalsing called the figures “worrying.” He is the police leader responsible for how the department handles issues related to care and security. Sitalsing said the numbers are “unfortunately not surprising. Police officers on the street experience daily that young people find it increasingly normal to carry a weapon.” On average, the police arrest three to four minors a day who have a weapon with them.The police cited the increase in threats of violence on social media and the glorification of weapons ownership and violence in drill-rap music as two of the reasons for the increase in gun ownership. The police themselves are also searching social media more often for signs of weapons possession. ""This increased attention can also be an explanation for the increase,"" said Sitalsing.“Carrying weapons should never be considered normal,” said Sitalsing. ""If you have a weapon in your pocket, you are more likely to actually use it. With all the risks of serious injury or even death."" Last November, for example, a 14-year-old boy in Hoorn died from a stabbing incident at his school, for which a 16-year-old suspect was arrested.The police are trying to prevent young people from owning weapons by checking more people for them, sometimes as a “preventive search,” Sitalsing said. The police and municipalities also organize weapon surrender campaigns, where people can hand in their weapons anonymously and with impunity.",Crime

https://nltimes.nl/2022/12/30/woman-receives-liver-heart-transplant-one-operation-dutch-first,Woman receives liver and heart transplant during one operation in Dutch first,30 December 2022 - 07:30,"In Groningen, a 35-year-old woman was given a new heart and liver from the same donor during a single operation, the University Medical Center (UMCG) said this week. According to the hospital, it was the first time in the Netherlands these two organs were transplanted during the same procedure.The woman is doing well, said the UMCG, and has started her recovery. The patient had a severe heart defect from birth, and was missing the right side of her heart. Her heart has already been operated on several times, but the deficiency has also affected her liver.That can lead to an accumulation of moisture and shortness of breath in cases like hers and, in nearly all cases, to the person's death when they are between the age of 30 and 40. In the Netherlands, there are around a few hundred people with this condition, according to the UMCG.A double transplant is better than when a patient gets a new heart first and then a new liver, explained a spokesperson from the UMCG. If somebody were to receive a new heart, they must take medication for the rest of their life to ensure that their body does not reject the transplanted organ.Then, if the patient requires a liver sometime later, it is hard to find one that will fit precisely with the medication the patient is already taking from the first transplant. Placing a new liver as a preventative measure before the heart transplant is necessary is also not possible as there are not enough donors available. Only people who specifically need the new organ are considered for a transplant. The operation took nearly 24 hours, with seventeen medical specialists and over thirty assistants working on the patient. Preparations started years ago for the procedure. The operation was very complicated, according to one of the surgeons. The patient's heart was defective, but so was the way in which the organ was positioned in the body. This made it difficult to attach the transplanted heart properly. The patient was said to have been given ""a second life"" due to the organ. Combination transplantations are not infrequent in the transplantation center in Groningen, such as heart and lung transplants. The spokesperson for the hospital would not say when the latest surgery was carried out. This is to protect the privacy of the patient, donor, and donor's relatives, as it makes it more difficult for them to track each other down.",Health
https://nltimes.nl/2022/12/29/hospitals-treating-abnormally-high-number-fireworks-victims,Hospitals not treating abnormally high number of fireworks victims,29 December 2022 - 19:40,"Hospitals are not busy at the moment with people who were wounded by fireworks, and only occasionally need to treat someone with those types of injuries. Several hospitals were contacted by ANP, with representatives explaining the situation there.There was a nationwide fireworks ban during the last two New Year's periods. Hospitals were very busy with coronavirus patients at that time, and the ban was supposed to help prevent an overload of patients. This year will be the first time since the 2019-2020 turn of the new year that fireworks are allowed to be bought and sold. Officially people are only allowed to buy them from Thursday, and only allowed to set them off between 6 p.m. on December 31 and 2 a.m. on January 1. In practice, that time frame is difficult to enforce.The burn victim center in Beverwijk has treated eleven people in the last few days, all children that were wounded by fireworks. ""The amount is no different from the last few years.""The OLVG in Amsterdam has treated three fireworks victims in the last few days. According to the hospital, New Year's parties and alcohol usage lead to more wounded than the fireworks, and more urgent care visits. In the last New Year's, the hospitality industry had to deal with restrictions. That led to a more significant reduction than the firework ban, according to the OLVG. ""It's just that the firework injuries lead to heavier and longer damage.""At the Haaglanden Medical Center in the Hague, the number of people with fireworks injuries is ""less than a handful; we see no difference compared to the last few years.""The Haga hospital in the Hague has seen no new fireworks patients in the last few days. The Groene Hart hospital in Gouda said, ""It is very quiet in our case when it comes to firework wounds; we see no difference with the last few years."" Similar reports came from the Alrijne hospital in Leiden, and the Canisius Wilhelmina hospital.A spokesperson there said they have ""actually hardly seen people with wounds from fireworks, no serious cases in any case. This is about comparable with the last couple of years.""Many hospitals have not seen a fireworks victim to date.

It concerns a fine of 56,065.45 euros. The Dutch public broadcasting system, known by the acronym NPO, believes that the young broadcaster has ""not complied with the legal obligation to cooperate in the performance of the public media mission since its entry into the public system.""The broadcaster did not act in accordance with public values ​​and does not meet the high standards of journalistic quality, the NPO said. ON! said it will appeal against the sanction imposed against them.In the event of repeated violations, the NPO has the option of submitting a request to the relevant state secretary to consider withdrawing ON!'s provisional recognition as a public broadcaster, effectively cutting them out of the system. The NPO is not yet doing this. ""At the moment, the focus is on ON! complying with the rules,"" a spokesperson said.State Secretary Gunay Uslu for culture and media policy did not want to comment substantively about the fine. Her spokesperson did say that if there is a request to withdraw the provisional recognition, then ""if necessary and relevant, we will enter into discussions with the parties involved and experts."" A decision could then determine if ON! remains in the system, or is forced out, in which case it would be the first time that a broadcaster's license has been revoked.The second penalty is equivalent to 1.5 percent of the ON! established annual budget for the year 2022. When determining the sanction, it was taken into account that ON! is an aspiring broadcaster, a sanction has already been imposed against them, and that ON! - despite the budgetary deduction - must reasonably remain able to carry out its mission.According to the NPO, the actions of Ongehoord Nederland have an ""enormous negative impact on the integrity and reputation of public broadcasting."" The NPO said it has addressed the broadcaster several times about complying with the rules, but ON! does not change, according to the NPO. The organization overseeing the public broadcasters accused ON! of freely misinterpreting the rules ""at its own discretion,"" saying the rules apply to all broadcasters under NPO.The chair of Ongehoord Nederland, Arnold Karskens, confirmed to ANP that ON! will appeal against the sanction. The broadcaster issued a response saying it properly adheres to cooperation within the NPO ""through active participation in all consultations."" The controversial broadcaster said that it was all the other broadcasters who do not wish to collaborate with them.The broadcaster also believes that the sanction shows that the NPO opposes a free press with diverse positions in the Netherlands. ON! called the sanction ""unjustified and inappropriate.""At the end of November, the Ombudsman issued a second report stating that the broadcaster still violates the Journalistic Code of the NPO on various points, for example when it comes to reliability.

Ahead of the appeal that will be argued in court in January, the Cabinet asked the Council of State for an injunction against several recent court rulings. Those prevented the Cabinet in specific cases from extending the amount of time it could take to issue visas to family members of recognized refugees who want to travel to the Netherlands. The Council of State denied the Cabinet's request on Thursday.""In both cases, the preliminary relief judge found the interest of the family members who will travel in connection with family reunification outweighs the interest"" of the state secretary who does not want to implement the court rulings, the Council of State said on Thursday. The rulings by the preliminary relief judge mean that the family members of two Turkish refugee status holders can immediately obtain permission to enter the Netherlands for family reunification.In recent weeks, several courts have struck down the Cabinet's travel restriction, partly because it conflicts with many national agreements and international treaties. State Secretary Eric van der Burg for asylum policy appealed against those rulings, and applied to the Council of State for a preliminary injunction that would halt implementation of the rulings from the courts of Amsterdam and Middelburg. This would have suspended the lower courts' decisions until a ruling is issued on appeal.However, the requests from the state secretary were rejected on the basis of a weighing of interests, the Council of State said. Van der Burg said in a response, ""We have taken note of the ruling and the IND will follow up on this."" The IND is the Dutch immigration office.Several courts have all ruled that the government's restriction on travel in connection with family reunification is illegal and that the family members of the refugee status holders who had gone to court for this must be allowed to come to the Netherlands.At the end of August, the Cabinet decided to impose a restriction on travel in connection with family reunification. This applied to family members of recognized refugees. A visa may be issued after approval no more than fifteen months following submission of the application for family reunification.If the refugee status holder acquires a home for his or her relatives traveling to the Netherlands, the visa can be issued earlier. The measure applies up to and including 2023 and, according to the Cabinet, is necessary to relieve the pressure on the overburdened asylum reception system.In January, the Council of State will hear the Cabinet's appeal. A final decision is expected a few weeks later, after which appeal will no longer be possible.",Politics
https://nltimes.nl/2022/12/29/prominent-dutch-virologist-coronavirus-test-travelers-china-good-idea,Prominent Dutch virologist: Coronavirus test for travelers from China is a good idea,29 December 2022 - 13:50,"A mandatory negative coronavirus test for people traveling from China is a good idea if that rule is implemented across all of Europe, said prominent virologist Ab Osterhaus. Currently, travelers from China have to complete a coronavirus test on arrival in Italy, but the Dutch Ministry of Health has said it does not intend to implement new restrictions at this time. The amount of people infected with coronavirus is rising rapidly in China, especially since the government has lifted nearly all restrictions. According to Osterhaus, it is to be expected that this wave will partly find its way to Europe. It is also easier for new variants to arise when the virus is circulating so strongly.But Osterhaus is not expecting big problems for Europe. ""We are in the tail-end of the pandemic. We have built up a suitable herd immunity."" That means that many people are better protected against the virus due to vaccination or because they have already been infected. If a new variant were to pop up, we could expect more coronavirus cases, but the virologist points out that this also happens regularly with the flu. ""And we don't implement these kinds of measures with that either."" Despite this, the measures against passengers traveling from China should be taken under consideration, he said. A negative test for people who arrive on a plane from that country is the most logical option, Osterhaus thinks.""We have plenty of experience with that."" A test on arrival is trickier, ""because what do you do if 10 percent of the flight tests positive?"" Most important is that any new rules apply to all of Europe because somebody wanting to travel to Italy from China could, in theory, travel to a different European country first, and then cross the border without a test. Good agreements about the conditions are also important, like the maximum period of validity for a negative test. But if measures are to be taken, it has to happen now.""You should not hold meetings about this for the next three weeks.""",Health

The 23-year-old winger passed his medical exam on Wednesday and has finalized his move from PSV Eindhoven to the six-time European champions. According to reports, Liverpool will pay PSV upwards of 50 million euros for Gakpo, including bonuses. Gakpo has been in fine form for PSV this season, scoring nine goals and getting 12 assists in fourteen league games for Ruud van Nistelrooij’s side. Gakpo then scored three goals in five games for the Netherlands at the FIFA World Cup in Qatar a month ago. “I am very grateful for the warm welcome, and I am looking forward to meeting everyone in the stadium and the city. There are a lot of amazing players I can learn from here to become a better player. I have heard many nice stories about the stadium and the atmosphere,"" Gakpo said in a statement released by his new team. He will wear the number 18 shirt for Liverpool.Gakpo was advised by the captain of the Netherlands, and current Liverpool vice-captain, Virgil van Dijk. He called the winger to convince him to sign for Liverpool. “He told me that this is the right move to develop and become a better player. That the club is a massive club but also like a real family, which is important to me as I am a family guy.""Liverpool is sixth in the English Premier League after a poor start left them adrift. However, Jurgen Klopp’s team won their last three matches and started to rise up the table.PSV now has a month to replace Gakpo, which is of utmost importance if Van Nistelrooij’s team want a shot at becoming the Eredivisie champions, and if they hope to progress further in the Europa League.",Sports
https://nltimes.nl/2022/12/29/dutch-history-teachers-think-children-learn-slavery-age-7,Dutch history teachers think children should learn about slavery from the age of 7,29 December 2022 - 11:20,"Marjan de Groot-Reuvekamp, the head of the association of history teachers in the Netherlands, is advocating for primary schools to start teaching children about the history of slavery in the Netherlands at an early age. This includes primary school children as young as seven, who should be taught about the colonial history and the legacy of slavery, she told De Telegraaf. “The critical approach to information about our own past is best started at an early age,"" said De Groot-Reuvekamp, who is trying to find new ways to approach the new civics curriculum in the Netherlands. ""People are often a bit apprehensive about discussing such things with young children. But I know from experience and research that kids find history super interesting, as long as you use language they understand,"" she told De Telegraaf.The debate on how to deal with the Netherlands' colonial past was evident in Prime Minister Mark Rutte's recent speech in which he apologized on behalf of the Dutch state for its involvement in slavery. In the speech, Rutte announced that the Netherlands will take responsibility for its colonial past and the Dutch government will establish a fund of 200 million euros to invest in social initiatives, to help people to process the impact of the slave trade, and to commemorate those enslaved and their descendants.The money will also be used to create more awareness and involvement. For example, the money may be used to pay for a research program to gain more insight into the impact of the history of slavery, and discrimination as well as racism should be given a permanent place in education in the Netherlands.Although many families wonder how best to deal with this sensitive topic so that children can properly absorb and understand it, there are several ways to do so, De Groot-Reuvekamp said. Parents can teach their children about slavery and the Dutch colonial past in an age-appropriate way through books and by visiting cultural institutions such as museums. Several Dutch museums offer education about the slavery past. For example, the Tropenmuseum in Amsterdam, which has exhibitions on Suriname and at the same time educates visitors about how the people of Suriname dealt with slavery, and the lasting consequences were for the population. The Scheepvaartmuseum, the country's National Maritime Museum in Amsterdam, makes colonization, racism and the slave trade visible through paintings, ship models, and other exhibits, according to the Dutch newspaper Trouw.",CultureLifestyle
https://nltimes.nl/2022/12/29/fireworks-sales-start-today-2-years-covid-restrictions-german-market-popular,Fireworks sales start today after 2 years of Covid restrictions; German market popular,29 December 2022 - 10:30,"For the first time in three years, consumers in the Netherlands can again legally buy fireworks starting on Thursday. The sale of fireworks on the Dutch market was banned the past two years due to restrictions during the coronavirus pandemic. The legal selling period lasts for three days, expiring on New Year’s Eve. The webshops where fireworks could be ordered in advance have been open since mid-November.A minimum age of 16 applies for the purchase or collection of fireworks categorized as F2. Households are also forbidden from having more than 25 kilograms of fireworks. The current restrictions only allow the sale of decorative fireworks, because since 2020 there has been a ban on explosive firecrackers that only produce a loud sound and possibly a flash. Fireworks sellers are also required to provide customers with free safety goggles and lighter fuses with their order.Fireworks may legally be detonated starting at 6 p.m. on December 31. The period ends on January 1 at 2 a.m. At least ten municipalities have put a ban on detonating fireworks, including during the New Year's Eve period. Fireworks may not be set off in Amsterdam, Rotterdam, Schiedam, Nijmegen and Apeldoorn, among others.The fireworks industry expects about 85 million euros in legal fireworks to be sold. That is an increase of over 10 percent more compared to 77 million euros in sales in 2019. Fireworks sellers have already seen the number of pre-sale orders rise sharply. The volume of pre-sale orders placed were between one-and-a-half to two times higher compared to the same period in 2019, according to SVNC, the association of Dutch consumer grade fireworks sellers.The pre-sales were also high across the border in Germany, where Dutch interest seems to be high again this year, possibly even bigger than before the coronavirus crisis, said VuurwerkDuitsland, a company with several locations on the German side of the border. Heron Fireworks in Emmerich also noted that a strikingly high number of fireworks packages have been ordered in advance from the Netherlands. Just like in the Netherlands, firework purchases in Germany can be collected from Thursday, and retailers can sell fireworks directly to consumers.German fireworks are generally cheaper and, according to experts, prettier than fireworks sold in the Netherlands. In addition, all types of fireworks are still for sale in Germany, from joke and prank fireworks such as snap pops, to very expensive, large flares and heavy explosive firecrackers. In the Netherlands, fireworks sellers must comply with strict rules, but in Germany, fireworks may be sold anywhere, for example in supermarkets. The road from the border near Nijmegen to a shopping center with many supermarkets and fireworks sellers in Kranenburg, Germany, carries the nickname Feuerwerk-Allee, or Firework Alley, during the last days of the year.Dutch consumers who buy fireworks in Germany can take a maximum of 25 kilograms across the border. At most points of sale, a buyer must be at least 18 years old, but 16-year-olds can already purchase items at some supermarkets. Having fireworks orders delivered to the home is prohibited. The firecrackers from Germany must also be provided with a Dutch-language manual. From Thursday to Saturday, the Marechaussee and police will more heavily patrol the border region to monitor the situation. Traffic controllers are often also needed to manage the miles-long traffic jams from the border to German fireworks shops and back.Checking all fireworks buyers is impossible, according to a police spokesperson. ""But anyone who crosses the border with a large, full trailer runs the risk of being pulled over. This can result in a fine of at least 100 euros and a mark on the criminal record.""",Business
