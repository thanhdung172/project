https://nltimes.nl/2023/01/05/hay-fever-season-gets-early-start-2023-due-warm-winter-weather,Hay fever season gets an early start in 2023 due to warm winter weather,5 January 2023 - 11:40,"It is still the middle of winter, but the hay fever season of 2023 has already started, according to Weeronline. Due to the mild weather at the end of December and the very mild turn of the new year, the first alder and hazel trees and shrubs have already bloomed.The recent rain means that few people sensitive to the pollen from these trees will suffer from complaints. However, when it is dry, symptoms can arise, according to the weather website.In the coming period, the alder and hazel trees will continue to bloom due to the mild weather. It should still be rather mild this week with high temperatures of about 12 degrees Celsius, according to Weeronline. Next week the afternoon temperature will be around 8 degrees, and during most of those nights the mercury will not drop below 5 degrees. Normally at this time of the year it is about 6 degrees during the day and the temperatures at night are around freezing point.Despite the high temperatures, the weather will feel more autumnal this week, according to the weather website. There will be many cloud fields, and significant wind marked by many periods of rain. The rainy moments are good news for people who are allergic to alder and hazel pollen, as the air is essentially washed clean.According to Weeronline, quite a few people suffer from alder and hazel pollen allergies, but even more people are allergic to birch pollen. This tree normally blooms in April and spreads pollen which can trigger strong allergic reactions. Of all trees in the Netherlands, birch causes the most complaints among people who suffer from hay fever.",HealthTechNature

Higher prices for everything from groceries to air travel forced consumers to spend more cash.But disposable income also increased. As a result, savings remained virtually unchanged.The savings amounted to 12.2 billion euros in the summer, 160 million euros less than a year earlier. Disposable income rose by 11.2 billion euros. Not only did wages go up due to new collective agreements, but more people also went to work.That meant that there was more money available to spend. Social benefits also increased.On the other hand, consumer spending rose across the board. Household expenditure on services such as the hotel and hospitality industry and recreation & culture rose in particular. Purchases were not only higher there than in the third quarter of 2021, when there were many more coronavirus restrictions. Everything also became more expensive.In the third quarter, 1.2 billion euros was banked as savings. Savings are counted when they are placed in a bank account or invested. Investments can also be made in property such as land and homes. Furthermore, households sold more shares in investments than they bought.",Business

His name was not revealed, but Duursma said, “It's a man we know well, he's been with the circus for about ten years.""According to illusionist Hans Klok, who was set to perform with the circus, the performer fell roughly 15 meters to the ground. Klok told Shownieuws he was in his dressing room at the time of the “very tragic” accident.“Now we have to wait and see,” he added. “Let’s hope it goes well.”Emergency services dispatch records show an ambulance was first sent to the scene just after 8:45 p.m. A trauma team was also sent there by helicopter at the same time, followed by a firefighter crew minutes later.There were many people in the audience at the time of the incident, including children. Victim support services were being arranged for them to help cope with the “nasty event” that they witnessed, the circus said.Upcoming shows will continue as planned. The circus has been operating for about 30 years. For the remainder of this season, they will produce two or three shows daily, with the run scheduled to end on January 8.",1-1-2CultureEntertainment

Members of the Dutch group's Telegram channel took credit for projecting racist messages linked to U.S. white supremacist organizations on the Erasmus Bridge in Rotterdam during the New Year's celebration there. Earlier this week, prosecutors called it a criminal act that was under investigation.The messages shown on the bridge used discriminatory language, some of which originated from an American white supremacist group, in addition to the ""14 Words"" quotation by David Lane, an American neo-Nazi who founded a white supremacist organization that was tied to the murder of a Jewish radio host. Lane died in prison in 2007.The projection on the bridge, which police speculate was shown from a boat, included a link to a website that is an online directory connects nine extremist groups with racist and anti-Semitic text and videos that also promotes Nazi ideology, NL Times confirmed after reporting by ANP. One of the organizations in the network claims to be global, four are located in North America alone, two in Europe, and another claims to be based in Australia. White Lives Matter is located in both North America and Europe, including the Netherlands and Germany.Groups listed on the network site include American neo-Nazi group NSC-131, whose members were present at the storming of the U.S. Capitol on January 6, 2021, according to WBUR. ""NSC-131 members see themselves as soldiers at war with a hostile, Jewish-controlled system that is deliberately plotting the extinction of the white race,"" according to the Anti-Defamation League in the United States.The group ""seeks to form an underground network of white men who are willing to fight against their perceived enemies through localized direct actions."" and they use racism and anti-Semitic messaging online, in graffiti, and in flyers distributed physically. The handing out of flyers is also a technique used by the group that organizers the white supremacist groups.The neo-Nazi and totalitarian Nordic Resistance Movement is also on the list. In 2018, a member of NRM was arrested in Sweden on accusations that he was preparing to attack two journalists. The group, which is pro-violence, was banned in Finland in 2020, according to the Middlebury Institute of International Studies. ""The organization’s goal is to overthrow democracy across the Nordic region and Scandinavia at large in favor of establishing a Third Reich-inspired Nazi dictatorship,"" the Institute wrote.""The NRM has a long and bloody history of armed attacks on private citizens, minority groups and democratic institutions. It poses an ongoing and serious public security threat,"" the Anti-Defamation League wrote.The Aryan Freedom Network, active in the United States, particularly in Texas, is also one of the groups included in the network. They were responsible for hurling slurs at member of the LGBTQI+ community, also recently at an all-ages drag show in Texas.The Public Prosecution Service (OM) said projecting the messages on the bridge is criminally punishable. The use of discriminatory hate speech was evident, ""based on the context in which the statements were made, and their coherence,"" the OM said.Prosecutors also noted the importance of freedom of speech as a fundamental right in the Netherlands. ""But there are limits to that freedom of expression. One of those limits is that expressions may never incite discrimination or offend another segment of the population.""",CrimePolitics

Slightly less than half of those victims were boys under the age of 18.At least 32 finger amputations were performed. The doctors also treated many broken bones, eye injuries and serious burns. Legal fireworks injured ten people. ""Just like in previous years,"" illegal fireworks were the biggest culprit, the NVPC concluded on the basis of a survey among plastic surgeons in the country. Incidentally, fifteen of the victims were hurt before 6 p.m. on December 31, the moment when it became legal to set off fireworks in most municipalities.During the New Year's period from 2019 into 2020, the plastic surgeons treated fifty victims. One year prior there were 44 people with serious injuries.""It is worrying that we are now back at that level,"" said plastic surgeon Annekatrien van de Kar.

There was an increase of 227,000 inhabitants, compared to 115,000 in 2021, according to the statistics office. With this growth, the number of inhabitants in the Netherlands stands at 17.8 million.In 2022, about 168,000 children were born, a reduction of over 11,000 from 2021 figures. About 169,000 people died last year. As a result, birth and death rates have remained about the same, so that population growth can be fully attributed to foreign immigration.A relatively high number of immigrants were registered last year, when about 402,000 people moved to the Netherlands. That is 150,000 more than in 2021. In every municipality the number of immigrants was higher than the number of emigrants.The larger cities in the Netherlands grew the fastest. Eindhoven and Almere had the strongest growth with 22 new people per thousand inhabitants. Of the major cities, only Rotterdam and Breda were slightly below the national average. The data does show that more people emigrated out of the Netherlands than moved to the Netherlands in the major cities, especially in the Randstad, but also Groningen and Eindhoven.Seven municipalities showed a per capita increase above 30 new inhabitants per thousand, where the national average was 13 per thousand. The seven municipalities include the Noordoostpolder, Waddinxveen, Diemen, Maassluis, Woudenberg and the islands of Vlieland and Schiermonnikoog.The number of inhabitants decreased in only nine of the 344 municipalities, which is less than in previous years. In 2020, the population fell in 61 municipalities. These municipalities were mainly located at the perimeter of the Netherlands, such as the coastal areas, or at the borders with Belgium and Germany.About 100,000 of the immigrants arrived from Ukraine after the Russian invasion in February. Some 89,000 of them have registered with a Dutch municipality since February. Many Ukrainians have also left the Netherlands, mainly back to Ukraine.After Ukraine, the most immigrants who settled in the Netherlands arrived from Syria, followed by Turkey, India and Poland.Without immigration, many municipalities would have experienced a contraction: 62 percent of them had a mortality rate that was higher than the birth rate. That figure was 53 percent in 2021, and the number has risen sharply in twenty years. In 2002, just 13 municipalities reported a death rate that outpaced new births.Since then, the number of municipalities has also decreased, because many municipalities have merged. The municipalities where more babies are born than people die are mainly in Flevoland, the Randstad region, and in and around Zwolle.Flevoland is the province where the population is growing the fastest, followed by Noord-Holland, Zuid-Holland and Utrecht. The growth in Flevoland was 22 new people per thousand inhabitants. In Noord-Holland it was sixteen per thousand inhabitants and in Zuid-Holland and Utrecht it was thirteen per thousand inhabitants. In Flevoland, the population grew because more people were born than died, because of domestic relocations, and also foreign immigration. In both Noord- and Zuid-Holland, on the other hand, there were more people who moved away from these provinces to other parts of the Netherlands.The difference between Zuid-Holland and Utrecht and the other provinces is not significant. Zeeland was at twelve new people per thousand inhabitants, Gelderland, Overijssel and Groningen at eleven, Limburg, Friesland and Drenthe closed the list with nine new residents per thousand inhabitants.",Politics

The measure is meant to guarantee that people earning money from legal sex work have not been coerced, and are protected from abuse, said newspaper AD in a report on Wednesday.It is not yet clear when the new measure will take effect. It will also give the cities the right to review company records from sex work operators, and to read the intake interviews of anyone working for them. Cities will also be able to randomly review the age of those workers, and to check that sex workers and the firms where they work are able to understand each other whether in Dutch, English, or another common language.André van Dorst is critical of the plan. He heads up an association of businesses that work in the industry, known as the Vereniging Exploitanten Relaxbedrijven. The victims of human trafficking are far more likely to be found in illegal sex businesses, and not properly licensed and registered companies acting out in the open. He said those forced into prostitution are trafficked on apps and websites.Further, The new rules will require both the operator and the city to maintain and process personal data. The data can be kept for up to five years.“It is not at all good for municipalities to register who is playing the role of the whore,” Van Dorst told the newspaper. It is “a useless solution, to the disadvantage of prostitutes who lose an important piece of privacy.” The measure is only meant as a show piece for municipalities to say they have their house in order.However, Ina Hut disagrees, saying that the limitation on the length of time that data is kept does continue their right to privacy. Hut is the director of CoMensha, an organization monitoring developments in human trafficking.“Unfortunately there is still forced prostitution, sometimes also by minors,” Hut said. “This change can also protect sex workers who do work voluntarily.''",HealthPoliticsCultureLifestyle
