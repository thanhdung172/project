His DNA was found on the weapon used in the murder, and in the car used by the two suspected perpetratorsthe OM said. The Public Prosecution Service explained their allegations in detail during an introductory session against the six suspects in the controversial murder case, which essentially restarted on Friday.In October 2021, Konrad W. came into the picture as detectives pressed ahead with the investigation. He likely returned to his homeland at the end of that year. Police in Poland tracked him down at the request of the Netherlands, and arrested him on September 26 last year. He was handed over to the Netherlands on October 12, and on Friday he had to appear in court for the first time during the public hearing in Amsterdam.According to the OM, he is complicit in the murder. W. was allegedly involved in the delivery of firearms, a getaway car and a bottle of petrol to set the vehicle on fire after the murder. The man did not want to testify, and invoked his right to remain silent.Peter R. de Vries was 64 years of age when he was shot on July 6, 2021 on the Lange Leidsedwarsstraat in the center of Amsterdam. He died nine days later. The two men accused of carrying out the assassination attempt, 36-year-old Kamil E. from Poland and 23-year-old Delano G. from Rotterdam, were caught soon after the assassination attempt. Last summer, the police arrested another four suspects, three of whom are still in custody. Among them is Krystian M. (27), who is said to have orchestrated the apparent contract killing.M. and W. are said to belong to a group of Polish people who are guilty of committing serious crimes. At the time of his arrest, M. was already in jail for a failed assassination attempt in Zeewolde. He too is remaining silent. In the courtroom, he wore a face mask and hid under the hood of a sweatshirt.Last year, the Public Prosecution Service demanded life imprisonment against G., who is suspected of pulling the trigger, and E., who is accused of driving the getaway car. The court was forced to postpone the verdict at the last minute and reopen the proceedings into the two after the Public Prosecution Service produced a new witness.This witness, numbered 5089, claims to be a friend of Krystian M. and reportedly made numerous explosive statements during interrogations. He was extensively questioned last month and those interrogations will continue this month. His statements suggested that Ridouan Taghi should be seen as the person who commissioned the murder of De Vries. Taghi's attorney previously rejected this accusation.During the delay caused by postponing the verdict, one of the judges on the panel pressed forward with plans to leave their job and relocate abroad. The situation required the court to order a mistrial. Last year, the court also decided to handle the cases against the two known suspects and the four new suspects all in one trial. It is not yet known when the substantive hearings in the trial will begin.",Crime

The driver left it there to board a plane, a spokesperson for the Koninklijke Mareuchaussee said to NU.nl.“It often happens that couriers drop off packages at Schiphol, but this time no one came back. We then saw on camera images how the gentleman left his van and checked in at the airport. Presumably, to go on a trip,” the spokesperson said. The Koninklijke Marechaussee is a policing force that works as part of the Dutch military and is responsible for airport security.The Marechaussee naturally considered the situation suspicious and called in a sniffer dog to examine the van for explosives and other contraband. They did not find anything suspicious.Technically, the courier did not commit a felony or a serious crime. The only illegal act was parking in a no-parking zone. “There will be a good conversation between him and his employer,” the Marechaussee spokesperson speculated.The owner of the courier company was caught completely unaware, and did not know the delivery worker had even planned a trip. Surprised colleagues went to pick up the van later on Wednesday evening.",Weird

The cold case team hopes that releasing the 65-year-old victim’s name will help them make contact with his family. Passersby found the torso, wrapped in blue plastic, floating in the IJ near the NDSM estate in Amsterdam-Noord on January 30, 2013. The police’s cold case team reopened the case last year. The team quickly identified the victim as the missing art dealer but did not release his name because his family had not yet been informed.Due to the war in Ukraine, the Dutch police have no contact with the Russian authorities. They hope that by now releasing Levin’s name, his family will make contact with them. According to the Telegraaf, Levin was involved in trading art and antiquities. In 1999, he was convicted of art smuggling. He spent a lot of time in Amsterdam.The Dutch police are still investigating Levin’s murder. One of the theories they’re working on is that Levin became the victim of extortion by a Russian gang or the Russian secret service, the newspaper wrote. ",Crime

Last year, the police handled 682 such cases, the National Police’s National Expertise Center for Honor-related Violence said to De Gelderlander. In 2021, there were 628 honor-related violence cases, and in 2018 there were 529. According to the police, the upward trend in this type of violence is mainly related to the influx of migrants and refugees.Over 20 percent of the honor-violence incidents in the past two years happened in the Dutch-Syrian community, the police told the newspaper. According to the police, that is logical, given the many people who fled the war in Syria in recent years. Before that, most cases happened in Turkish and Moroccan circles. Honor-violence involves violent incidents to protect or restore the “sullied honor” of the family, for example, if a family member is accused of unchaste behavior by their partner or another family. Resistance to choosing a partner, extramarital relations, or opposition to following family rules can also spark these types of incidents.The honor-violence incidents the police handled in recent years included threats, stalking, assault, forced marriage, abduction, and even manslaughter.",Crime

According to Kuipers, the Eerste Kamer must approve the bill so that the Netherlands can set mandatory travel restrictions on travelers from China. Parliament approved the bill, officially called the Public Health Act, in mid-December. At the end of December, Kuipers urged the Eerste Kamer to handle the Public Health Act quickly. The Senate scheduled the debate on the bill for January 17, the day after it returns from recess. The decision for whether or not to call back the Senators from their recess will be made at 1:00 p.m. on Friday, sources told NOS. European Ministers have discussed the Covid-19 situation in China several times in recent days. The Member States agreed to follow a “coordinated approach” to travelers from China to avoid travelers circumventing restrictions by going through another country. The EU “strongly encourages” travelers from China to the EU to get tested before departure and wear a face mask on the plane. The health authorities will also check for virus particles in wastewater on airplanes from China on a random basis. The Netherlands has not yet introduced such restrictions because it has no legal basis for them. The Public Health Act will be that legal basis once the Senate approves it. From Thursday, travelers from China can get tested for Covid-19 for free at Schiphol Airport. The health authorities are also checking sewage water around the airport for coronavirus particles.",HealthPolitics

Europe should work with the United States, “and other countries in the free world,” the leaders of ten parties wrote in an opinion piece in the Volkskrant. “We can work with all countries and seek dialogue, but we have to stand up when people and their rights, freedoms, and lives are at stake.”“Millions of Iranian women and men want freedom, fight for that freedom, and do so at the risk of their lives,” the party leaders wrote. They deserve support, the party leaders believe. “The Iranian regime violates universal human rights and threatens international security through its military activities. That is why we need to put greater pressure on this regime.”The parties want the Netherlands to submit a proposal to the EU to put the Iranian Revolutionary Guards on the list of terrorist organizations. They also called for sanctions against “specific persons from the Iranian regime and their close relatives,” as has happened before with powerful Russians. “In this way, we prevent them from violating freedoms in Iran and then coming here to enjoy our freedoms at, for example, our universities. And in this way, we protect Iranians here so that they are not confronted with (family members of) their oppressors from Iran.”The parties also called for better enforcement of sanctions, including improving information sharing and punishing countries if they help Iranians evade sanctions. The security services should better inform companies “so that an entrepreneur can also find out whether a company in Dubai is actually an Iranian company evading the sanctions.” In addition, Iranians in Europe must be better protected against threats and intimidation from the Iranian government.The opinion piece follows a motion in parliament to put the Iranian Revolutionary Guards on the list of terrorist organizations. Only Forum voor Democratie voted against the motion. The leaders of the coalition parties VVD, D66, CDA, and ChristenUnie, and opposition parties PvdA, SP, GroenLinks, Denk, JA21, and SGP all signed the opinion piece.",Politics

That is entirely due to the prices of gas and electricity. They spiked earlier last year but have recently decreased. However, energy is still considerably more expensive than a year ago. The decrease in inflation is not noticeable in supermarkets. The pace at which food, beverages, and tobacco prices rise was slightly higher in December than in November.

According to data from insurance company Interpolis, there was a 39 percent increase compared to 2022. Interpolis said this was because of the coronavirus, the flu, and the worker shortage, which stacked more work pressure on other colleagues. Interpolis has said it is worrying that the number of people absent for a long time rose in 2022 compared to 2021 and the years before the coronavirus pandemic. The insurer said that the staff shortage is the main reason for that. Interpolis tated that a quarter of SME owners are worried about the health of their staff. “We continue to see the worries from SME owners about having and retaining enough staff through the year. When an organization struggles with not enough personnel, it creates added work pressure for its current employees,” said Rene Voets at Interpolis.Eventually, the increased pressure becomes too great, and employees either quit or go on leave, “which then increases the workload even more for other employees.”Interpolis expects the high work pressure to remain an important topic this year. The insurance company advises entrepreneurs to speak about this with staff. “Only this way can you keep a grip on it with employees, and you can see how you could divide the work pressure in a timely fashion to stop lengthy absences.”",Health
