https://nltimes.nl/2022/12/26/400-cases-abusive-workplace-behavior-dutch-creative-sector-reported-2022,About 400 cases of abusive workplace behavior in Dutch creative sector reported in 2022,26 December 2022 - 09:28,"MORES, the reporting center for transgressive behavior in the cultural and creative sector, has so far this year received a total of 389 reports about abuse in the entire cultural sector, said MORES board member Amber de Vente on Monday. The number of registered reports in 2021 was just over 50 in total, marking a near seven-fold increase in one year’s time.The number of reports rose sharply after the announcement of the major NPO investigation into the culture of fear and bullying in the media world. The incidents involve both television and radio programs, but also other parts of the cultural sector. The filed reports initially cross the desk of confidential advisors assigned by MORES. De Vente insisted that they do not automatically share those reports with commercial broadcasters or NPO, the organization overseeing public broadcasting in the Netherlands.Those filing reports go directly through the MORES hotline, and are later contacted by a confidential advisor, she explained. ""They listen and tell the reporters what the possible scenarios are. But it what happens with their report is always their own choice. We as a board are completely independent of this and are never aware of the reporters’ personal information.”MORES previously stated that the journalism that shed a light on the culture of fear by the leaders of award-winning television program De Wereld Draait Door (DWDD) was part of the reason that a large stream of stories about the culture of fear in the workplace within the media sector began to surface.The NPO has announced a major investigation into the misconduct behind the scenes of DWDD. MORES has an advisory role in this study. RTL said it has not recently received any reports about misconduct. Talpa was not willing to say whether concrete action has been taken after all the revelations about DWDD.Talpa itself was also embroiled in scandal recently due to unaddressed complaints about sexual misconduct allegations and bullying behavior behind the scenes of The Voice of Holland. Separate from DWDD, NPO broadcaster NOS was also recently in the news because of transgressive behavior at NOS Sport which complainants say went unaddressed for about 15 years.",CrimeBusiness

His speech was praised by Linda Nooitmeer from NiNsee, the national institute for the history of Dutch slavery, Rabin Baldewsingh, the National Coordinator against Discrimination and Racism, and Dagmar Oudshoorn, the chair of the former Slavery History Dialogue Group.In his Christmas speech, the king followed up on the apologies that Prime Minister Mark Rutte offered on behalf of the government last Monday. “No one now is to blame for the inhumane acts that were perpetrated on the lives of men, women and children,” said the king. “But by honestly facing our shared past and acknowledging the crime against humanity that was slavery, we are laying the foundations for a shared future.” He said the coming commemorative “will hold our attention,” and pledged he and Queen Maxima will “remain involved.”Linda Nooitmeer was impressed by the speech, she said in an initial reaction. ""I thought it was a very nice message. The king referred to the apologies, to the ‘crime against humanity’ and to descendants of people who lived in slavery. He also indicated that the commemoration year in 2023 has the attention of the Royal Family. I was pleased to hear that.""The king's overall message, “Let's keep holding on to each other, even in intense times with strong emotions,” touched Nooitmeer.""It is very important to embrace this history together,” Nooitmeer said.Rabin Baldewsingh found the emotion of the king's words to be noteworthy. ""In the end, this is what it's all about. It was really a very connecting speech."" As an example, Baldewsingh mentions the way in which the king used the impact of the slavery past to call on people to join in and participate. According to the National Coordinator against Discrimination and Racism, it is ""really great"" that the king underlined the apologies that Rutte has previously expressed with his words. ""I am very happy with these connecting words. It came across as very sincere. I think an important foundation has been laid for reconciliation towards the memorial year.""Dagmar Oudshoorn, is the director of Amnesty International Netherlands in addition to having chaired the Slavery History Dialogue Group. Oudshoorn also described the king’s words as being both beautiful and drawing connections. “I think the speech is very important for the descendants of enslaved people."" According to her, the king's words mainly reflected what the advisory body stated in its report 'Chains of the Past'. ""We have a shared past and we must also move towards a shared future.""Next year, from July 1, 2023 to July 1, 2024, will be the Commemoration Year of Slavery Past.

When requesting information about accounts held by notaries for clients, banks often ran up against the notaries' duty of confidentiality. It was now agreed that a statement by the notary about his or her own money laundering checks will suffice, reported the Dutch Banking Association (NVB).To combat money laundering or terrorist financing, banks are required to investigate the origin of the money held in client accounts. However, due to the duty of confidentiality, this is difficult in the case of so-called third-party money accounts of notary offices, which contain funds that do not belong to the notary or the office itself.It has now been decided that the bank no longer has to investigate the funds in these third-party accounts itself, but can rely on the statement of these accounts issued by a notary. This solution came about after the NVB consulted with the regulator Nederlandsche Bank and the Ministries of Justice and Security and Finance. Notaries must report each time they issue such a statement to the regulator for their sector, the Financial Supervision Bureau,.It is very important to banks to comply with the legal requirements for combating money laundering. Due to shortcomings in checks for possible criminal money flows, ING and ABN AMRO have already reached settlements of hundreds of millions of euros with the Public Prosecution Service.

It was his tenth such Christmas speech since ascending to the throne in April 2013.Many of you are under a shadow of worry this Christmas. “It's a tough time,” people tell me. Is there enough money to pay the bills now that everything has become so expensive? Where can I finally find a suitable home or a student room? And what about the future of my company?It is also a confrontational time, because isn’t climate change forcing us to make drastic choices? And are we not running up against restrictions in our country with its limited space and conflicting interests? We can feel it in our bones that we can no longer postpone difficult decisions. Patches and emergency bandages no longer help. It has to be different.That confronts us with the question of where we want to go from here. What kind of society do we really want, and how do we hold on to our values ​​- freedom, equality, social justice - on the way to a new stability?Very complicated! I understand the uncertainty that can be felt in many places, the stress and also the anger. It can then be a relief to let off some steam. But we must not get bogged down in scapegoating and cynical criticism or indifference.Democracy does not mean that those who shout the loudest get their way. Democracy means working together on solutions that the majority can identify with while respecting everyone's fundamental rights. This involves careful consideration of all interests.The latter is essential, for example in the relationship between rural and urban areas. It is high time to strengthen the connection. Because what would the Randstad be without the provincial regions? And the provincial regions without the Randstad? We desperately need each other.Let's try – wherever we live – to escape prejudice. Let's make sure we do not lose hold of each other! At least give each other the benefit of the doubt. My call to each and every one of you is: join in, listen in, think along, take part!Sometimes it can help to look outward and draw on the example of others. Like the Ukrainian people who for ten months now have been standing up with incredible courage and unity against the brutal violence by Russia. The promise of Christmas – the hope of peace – lives in all Ukrainian hearts, and in ours.The wisdom of the elderly can also provide inspiration. I am reminded of Gratitude, a short book by neurologist Oliver Sacks, written towards the end of his life. It made him happy to see young, talented people all around him. “The future is in good hands,” he writes.""The future is in good hands."" I'd like to tell him. I meet them everywhere. Young people with ideals and imagination. They feel jointly responsible and are prepared to take the future on their shoulders.There is so much resilience in the young generation! But young people cannot do it alone. They rightly say, “Don't put it all on us. Listen to us, give us space, trust us, help us, but take personal responsibility and live up to it.”We don't always realize it, but we are capable of so much more than we think. I am convinced that we can also successfully conclude very complex problems and heal painful wounds, so that we can move forward together. Even when there are intense emotions involved.An important example of this is the acknowledgment of the suffering inflicted on people during the colonial era.Over the past year, my wife and I have spoken to people of all ages about this topic, including descendants of people who lived in slavery several generations ago. In the upcoming commemorative year, this will keep our focus. We will remain involved.No one now is to blame for the inhumane acts that were perpetrated on the lives of men, women and children. But by honestly facing our shared past and acknowledging the crime against humanity that was slavery, we are laying the foundations for a shared future.A future in which we stand against all contemporary forms of discrimination, exploitation and injustice.The apologies offered by the Cabinet are the beginning of a long road. Let's keep holding on to each other, even in intense times with strong emotions.Marieke Lucas Rijneveld wrote her own poem when, after a fuss, he decided against translating The Hill We Climb after some commotion. It is called Alles bewoonbaar. A combination of empathy, hope and belief in our future together.These are the last lines:Jij wil juist verbroedering, je wil één vuist, en wellicht is je handnu nog niet krachtig genoeg, of moet je eerst die van de ander vastpakken om te verzoenen, moet je daadwerkelijk de hoop voelendat je iets doet wat de wereld zal verbeteren, al moet je dit nietvergeten: kom na het knielen weer overeind en recht samen de rug.I wish you all – wherever you are and whatever your personal circumstances – a blessed Christmas celebration.The poet, Marieke Lucas Rijneveld, who became the first Dutch winner of the International Booker Prize in 2020, was initially asked to translate Amanda Gorman’s poem The Hill We Climb, which she recited at the 2021 inauguration of U.S. President Joe Biden. Instead, Rijneveld composed his own poem, Alles bewoonbaar, or Everything Inhabitable. The portion cited by Willem-Alexander was translated by Michele Hutchinson as:what you want is fraternity, you want one fist, and maybe yourhand isn’t yet powerful enough, or maybe you should first take the handof another in reconciliation, you actively need to feel the hope thatyou are doing something to improve the world, though you mustn’tforget this: stand up again after kneeling and straighten together our backs.An English translation was published by The Guardian.",Politics

The speech was recorded in the DNA Salon of the Huis ten Bosch palace in The Hague several days before it was broadcast on December 25.Dutch King Willem-Alexander used his Christmas address on Sunday to discuss why the Netherlands must now face up to its history involving slavery, while also acknowledging people’s fears about money amid a year of exceedingly high inflation and expensive energy bills. The speech of just over six minutes, was more specific than in past years, though also continued with his consistent message of being more accepting and understanding of people’s differences.“Let's try – wherever we live – to escape prejudice. Let's make sure we do not lose each other. At least give each other the benefit of the doubt,” he said. “My call to each of you and each of you is: hook up, listen in, think along, join in.”Along those lines, Willem-Alexander used what was perhaps his most specific Christmas address to call on people to reject “discrimination, exploitation and injustice,” while pledging that he and Queen Maxima will be firmly involved in how the Netherlands addresses the country’s history of slavery. Prime Minister Mark Rutte formally apologized on behalf of the Dutch State for how the Netherlands supported the slave trade, and said Willem-Alexander would take part in a ceremony commemorating the 150th anniversary of the total abolition of slavery in the Kingdom at an event in Amsterdam on July 1.“Over the past year, my wife and I have spoken to people of all ages about this topic, including descendants of people who lived in slavery several generations ago,” Willem-Alexander said. “No one now can be blamed for the inhumane acts that were perpetrated on the lives of men, women and children. But by honestly facing our shared past and acknowledging the crime against humanity that was slavery, we are laying the foundations for a shared future. A future in which we stand against all contemporary forms of discrimination, exploitation and injustice.”He also put special emphasis on how many people in the Netherlands are faced with new worries this Christmas, brought on by a variety of issues the country’s residents were not faced with just one year ago. Willem-Alexander said he knows it is a ""confrontational time,"" where residents are afraid they cannot pay the bills, or afford what they have grown accustomed to in previous years do to the rising cost of living. He also acknowledged the difficulties many people face with housing, including students, and entrepreneurs trying desperately to keep their businesses running.He implored on people not to let the stress and anger boil over in such a way where people lash out at others when blowing off steam. ""But we must not get bogged down in scapegoating and cynical criticism or indifference,"" he said. ""Democracy does not mean that those who shout the loudest get their way. Democracy means working together with respect for everyone's fundamental rights on solutions that the majority can identify with,"" he continued.In light of this, he asked that people continue to join in and participate in society, and to be more accepting of different perspectives and opinions. “Sometimes it can help to look outward and draw on the example of others, like the Ukrainian people who have been standing up against the brutal violence by Russia for ten months now, with incredible courage and unity. The promise of Christmas – the hope of peace – lives in all Ukrainian hearts, and in ours.”The king also spoke in praise of the younger generations of the Netherlands with a reference to neurologist and author Oliver Sacks, who noted “The future is in good hands,” in his book, Gratitude.”I meet them everywhere. Young people with ideals and imagination,” the king said. “They feel jointly responsible and are prepared to take the future on their shoulders.”Early in his speech, Willem Alexander also addressed the questions about climate change and the need to “make drastic decisions” where the country is bumping up against limitations on space and conflicting interests. “We feel it in our bones that we can no longer postpone difficult decisions. Patches and emergency bandages no longer help. It has to be different.”The speech was Willem-Alexander’s tenth Christmas address as King of the Netherlands, a role he took on after his mother, Beatrix, stepped down in April 2013. The speech was recorded in the DNA Salon, a room within his present residence, the Huis ten Bosch Palace.Formerly known as the Green Salon, the DNA Salon was renovated between 2016-2019 to include tens of thousands of bricks.

Also Albert Heijn supermarkets were busy with people coming to do their last Christmas shopping.In total, the Payments Association counted more than 22 million payments with debit and credit cards at Dutch store checkouts on Friday, worth roughly 740 million euros. That is significantly more than the busiest day in 2019, the last year before the Covid-19 pandemic. On Saturday, about 21 million card transactions were processed, with a total value of about 675 million euros.""In previous years, the daily record always fell on the last Saturday before Christmas.

A lot is also spent online, but not as much as earlier this year around the Black Friday bargain festival.According to trade union FNV, the queues outside de Bijenkorf in Amsterdam were not just the result of the huge influx of people wanting to buy a Christmas present in a hurry. In fact, employees were also on strike. The union organized campaigns at the department store for weeks, with some of the employees participating each time. De Bijenkorf admitted then that some departments were temporarily understaffed during that time.

https://nltimes.nl/2022/12/25/cabinet-proposes-new-law-ban-parties-undermine-democracy,Cabinet proposes new law to ban parties that undermine democracy ,25 December 2022 - 08:10,"The Cabinet published a new bill that would allow political parties to be banned if they undermine the democratic rule of law, or if they propose abolishing the rule of law. If the bill is passed, it will mean that courts can impose a ban ""as a last resort if a party wants to destroy democracy,"" according to Interior Minister Hanke Bruins Slot.It is already possible to ban a political party, but on different grounds than what was written into the new bill. This is now only possible if a party poses a threat to public order - as is the case for other organizations, such as motorcycle gangs. The new Political Parties Act, as the bill is officially called, is much more specific.Minister Bruins Slot said she considers parties ""of vital importance."" In a statement, she added, ""The parties that also gain our trust with our votes must never endanger our democracy in the process.""
Ideally, the power to ban parties should rest with a constitutional court, but that does not yet exist in the Netherlands. In the current proposal, the Supreme Court addresses this.If it were up to the Cabinet, the court would soon be allowed to ban parties if they preach violence and use violence to dismantle democracy or violate fundamental rights. The rules are strict, as had been recommended in several expert opinions. Ultimately, the European Court of Human Rights can review whether the party in question should have been banned.The new law regulates more than just the ban on parties. It also contains stricter rules on the transparency of political parties, for example in the area of their finances and internal organization.Furthermore, political parties active in municipalities, water associations and provinces will receive additional funding: more than 25 million euros over a three-year period. ""This will make parties less dependent on donations,"" the minister said. A newly established law on the Political Parties Authority Act is to provide oversight.This law is largely the result of the work of a committee led by Johan Remkes, which issued policy advice in 2018. The proposal is currently in consultation, which means that everyone, both experts and citizens, can respond to the law until 22 March. Only later will the proposal be discussed in the Tweede Kamer.",Politics
