Already earlier this week, the vote was expected to pass the lower House of Parliament, after a number of amendments were approved by a majority at the request of parties which were on the fence.As a result, the law passed by a large 93-48 majority thanks to the backing of the coalition parties, which were joined by SGP, Volt, PvdA, and GroenLinks. Both of the latter parties were needed for passage through the Eerste Kamer, the Dutch Senate.There was wide agreement that the current pension system was out of date. The bill is meant to make the system more flexible and in line with the current labor market trends by shifting the massive 1.4 to 1.5 trillion euros in pension assets from one collective pot to more individual pension funds. One goal is that young workers, including those on temporary and flexible contracts, can build up their pensions from a younger age and more rapidly. Additionally, pensions should be able to be indexed in line with inflation more readily if the investments perform well.Concerns include a higher level of risk that the pension funds may now face. Additionally, politicians want guarantees that the transition to the new system will not damage the standing of middle-aged workers.To win over PvdA and GroenLinks, the coalition compromised on three important amendments. Working people should be able to start building up a pension from the age of 18, instead of 21. A waiting period will be eliminated so temporary and flexible workers can immediately accrue their pension. Additionally, if the bill becomes a law, the Cabinet must quickly address the situation if it turns out that segments of the working population are not growing their pensions fast enough.Pension minister Carola Schouten said she was pleased with the results. She called it the “most extensive” handling of a bill in her career. “And that's good, because the law has improved through all those debates.""To become a law, the measure may have to be quickly taken up in the Senate after the Christmas and New Year’s recess. The provincial elections in May will determine the composition of the Senate. Support for Prime Minister Mark Rutte’s VVD, the largest party, has fallen steadily since last July, as has support for the second largest party, D66, which is also in the coalition. Support for the CDA has also dropped off. Meanwhile, support for the PVV, BBB, and Ja21 has been rising, and both PvdA and GroenLinks seem to be trending more positively in polling over the last year.",Politics

Kaag, who is also a deputy prime minister, spoke about the problem on Thursday evening on the talk show Op1.She mentioned one specific example where someone wrote, “Kuthoer, you will get a bullet in your head.” The slur, “kuthoer,” translates directly to English as “cunt whore.”Kaag said, “So, I don’t read it anymore,” referring to messages on social media.Kaag is receiving protection, ""and not just a little,"" she said on set during the talk show. The politician, who was looking back on the past year during the conversation, did say that the threats are no reason for her to stop.In addition to threats, she said she is also frequently called names such as “witch,” “terrorist” and “thief” on social media. “I am not going to attempt to explain the systematic character assassination is committed against me; they should explain that,” she said referring to those who write the messages. “I am a woman with experience, I am a leader of a political party, and I stand by our views.”At the beginning of this year, demonstrator Max van den B. stood outside her home address with a lit tiki torch shouting conspiracy slogans. Prior to that, a 43-year-old man who made death threats against her had to appear in court at a hearing she attended.Kaag explained on Thursday evening the impact it has had on her children, who for a time feared coming home in case something terrible would happen.“But every child is different. One remains much more wary, and the other completely panics when I say I'm going to walk the dogs.”Reporting by ANP and NL Times",CrimePolitics

The airport operator has reached a partial agreement about this with the labor unions FNV, CNV and VPS during negotiations for new collective bargaining agreements.The deals do not concern baggage handlers or security guards. The collective agreement does cover the approximately 2,300 employees who work for Schiphol Nederland and runs from April 2023 to October 2024. These are employees who work in the various departments of the Schiphol organisation, such as press officers and administrative employees.The staff will receive an 8 percent salary increase from April 1, and wages will be increased by more than 3 percent from January 1, 2024. In addition, employees will also receive a one-off payment of 2,000 euros gross, in proportion to the hours they work. The year-end bonus will also be increased, as will the minimum wage. FNV director Marcelle Buitendam said it finally represents a ""real thirteenth month"" bonus.The deal is only partially completed. At the beginning of next year, Schiphol will continue discussions with the trade unions to reach a full collective agreement. This concerns other matters, such as travel costs, sustainability issues, and different types of services. ""It was important for us to quickly provide employees with clarity about a pay increase at this time. We are pleased that we succeeded,"" said Buitendam.",Business

According to the UWV, the tension on the labor market eased slightly in the third quarter.For example, the number of people on unemployment benefits continued to fall. Also, for the first time in a long while, the number of unfilled vacancies also decreased.According to the UWV, this is the first time since the end of 2020 that the shortage has decreased. Tension on the labor market has increased for six consecutive quarters since the end of 2020. From the second quarter of 2021, the record was even broken five times in a row. This continuous increase came to an end in the third quarter of this year.""Compared to the second quarter of 2022, the number of unfilled vacancies decreased by 5.8 percent, to 451,900 in total. Meanwhile, the number of people with unemployment benefit that elapsed no more than six months earlier continued to fall by 4.2 percent. For example, there were again fewer job seekers in the third quarter, but also fewer vacancies for the first time since the end of 2020,"" said UWV labor market advisor Frank Verduijn in a statement.According to the UWV, workers and job seekers often still have a wide choice when it comes to finding a job or switching to a new job.

The minister sees that internationalization has many positive aspects, but also many disadvantages, such as a high workload for teachers and problems with housing. Dijkgraaf also fears that the affordability and quality of education will eventually come under pressure.The minister said exceptions should be made for ""very limited and targeted recruitment for specific training"" for professions where there is a shortage and in regions where populations are declining. In all other cases, the minister requested an ""urgent"" move to ""a full stop of the active recruitment of international students.""In February, the minister will present a package of proposals to limit the influx of international students. This may concern administrative agreements and laws, but also the requirements set for the language of study programmes.One of the reasons international students find higher education in the Netherlands an attractive option is because of the wide range of degree programs taught in English. Until the package of measures is available, the minister hopes that the educational institutions will voluntarily cooperate.At the end of last month, the SP and the CDA both requested a freeze on recruiting international students. They were supported by a parliamentary majority.",Politics

The men were taken into custody by the DSI tactical unit that specializes in the intervention of terrorist threats, or arresting people who may have ready access to firearms.The two men, aged 20 and 22, were arrested in Stein on Wednesday evening, and the arrest was confirmed a day later. The town of 25,000 people is wedged between Geleen and the Belgian border.""During the arrest and subsequent search of the suspects' home, no weapons or explosives were found,"" the Public Prosecution Service said. The investigation into them began when the intelligence service, AIVD, obtained information about them and passed it on to prosecutors and the national police unit.During the arrest on Crostolostraat at about 10 p.m., residents heard four distinct, loud blasts, according to the Telegraaf. Witnesses thought shots were fired, and police said the sounds may have come from authorities breaking into the home, or devices used to disorient the suspects. Area residents were ordered to remain indoors by the heavily armed police officers.“We are just as surprised and shocked as the neighborhood. We have never received any alarming signals about this family,"" said Karel Smitsmans, the director of Zaam Wonen, the housing corporation that rents out the home raided on Wednesday. “If what we hear is true, then we have a problem.

Until December this year, almost 4,500 batteries were stolen, while last year there just under 1,500 were taken.""Stealing an e-bike is such a good revenue model for a criminal that they even steal bicycles to fill orders,"" said Guus Wesselink of SAFE, a non-profit association that focuses on tackling bicycle and e-bike theft. As police face difficulties with staff shortages and a high workload, there is more difficulty enforcing e-bike theft, he said.""Moreover, both e-bikes and batteries are not yet registered with a frame number. It is open season for criminals.""The police also recognize the increase in e-bike battery theft as a problem and want to make people more alert to this common form of theft. ""A battery is easily worth more than 500 euros. A stolen bicycle including battery can quickly yield more than 1,000 euros,"" police said.""It is also possible that more criminals have become active in this form of crime.

The latter expressed concern about what seems to be an increase in their region. ""Previously we only saw these types of burns in December, last year they came in November and this year we saw them in October,"" a spokesperson for Martini Hospital said.However, he said there were no indications that the incidents were caused by heavier explosives, but rather the more common fireworks many children are allowed to use, like firecrackers and spinning tops. ""For example, we are seeing children who have suffered a burn on the bottom of their foot,"" the spokesperson told RTL Nieuws. ""This was caused by kicking wiith a shoe at a top burning on the ground. That gives a loud bang and is therefore a popular challenge on social media.""RTL Nieuws also noted that there was a warning issued last year calling for people, especially children, to stop stepping on ignited fireworks just because they seem to be innocent and harmless. A victim can suffer third-degree burns if the firecracker explodes and burns through a shoe.The Rotterdam and Beverwijk hospitals said that the number of patients that they have seen so far this year is similar to previous years.

Though the Center for Information and Documentation on Israel (CIDI) did not state any politicians or political parties by name, newly re-elected prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, has formed a coalition between his Likud party and staunch right wing parties, including the ultranationalist far-right Noam party led by Avi Maoz. The coalition was formally presented on Wednesday.The Noam party is known for being opposed to LGBTQ rights, and does not consider non-Orthodox Jewish people to be legitimate, according to the Associated Press. Additionally, the party is against Arabs being allowed to teach Jewish students in school, and women being allowed to serve in the military.Should any coalition parties make discriminatory statements, CIDI said it would speak out against them. ""Our tireless fight against anti-Semitism means that we will firmly reject other forms of hate as well – including, when necessary, in our dealings with representatives of the Israeli government. We will reject inflammatory rhetoric used by some members of the governing coalition,"" CIDI said in a statement. ""This rhetoric is not representative of Israel's democratic values, its role as a homeland for all Jews, and its relentless quest for peace.""Additionally, CIDI called on the new coalition government to promote equality for all citizens of Israel, ""regardless of religion, ethnicity, sexual orientation or gender identity.""Maoz also wants Israeli law to to take on a stricter component of hardline Jewish religious law, according to the BBC. The party campaigned in 2019 with the slogan, ""Israel chooses to be normal,"" calling for an end to gay pride parades, and encouraging women to stay at home and raise a family as their primary contribution to society.Leaders of another key party in the coalition, Religious Zionism, also push for the full annexation of the West Bank.",Politics

The investigation showed that the police officer did not keep their finger on the pistol slide when aiming the weapon at the suspect, according to the OM.Prosecutors said that police officers are trained to keep their fingers off the trigger in such situations. As such, ""significant blame"" should be placed on the officer for the incident, for not following the proper procedure when drawing a firearm, the OM concluded.The police officer was notified of the OM's decision.

Psychological issues are also playing a role in absenteeism as people are facing more pressure at work, according to health and safety services ArboNed and HumanCapitalCare. Due to the tight labor market making hiring difficult, this work pressure is already high, but it will get worse when colleagues are absent due to illness.The two occupational health and safety services together have about 63,000 employers as customers and therefore have data on about a million employees. They noticed that psychological absenteeism grew remarkably in 2022. The overall absenteeism rate is 4.8 percent, which is higher than before the coronavirus pandemic. In 2019, for example, the absenteeism rate was still 4.5 percent.There were major differences throughout the year. At the beginning of the year there was another coronavirus wave, but the flu also returned. That image shifted in April, but in the summer there was a new coronavirus wave. In addition, long-term absenteeism due to psychological complaints was 10 percent higher than before the coronavirus pandemic.Coronavirus and flu will also remain visible in 2023, the health and safety services expect. However, the prevention of psychological absenteeism in particular is receiving renewed attention, especially now that the labor market remains tight.""Mental complaints cause more and more people to drop out, while in many cases this can be prevented with proper and timely help,"" said medical director Redmer van Wijngaarden of ArboNed.

That is three percent more than last year, the police said in response to a report from De Telegraaf published on Thursday. According to the police, the increase can be explained by the disappearance of the coronavirus measures, which means that people are more often away from home.Compared to 2019, the burglary figures have fallen by 36 percent. That year, 39,365 home burglaries were registered.""As the police, we prefer to compare the figures of 2022 with those of 2019, the pre-coronavirus time, to make a correct comparison,"" said Sybren van der Velden, who coordinates the home burglary approach for the police. ""People are still working from home a lot after coronavirus.

""On Christmas Day and Boxing Day, two to three times as many home burglaries are committed than on an average day in the year,"" stated Van der Velden.

According to that study, most investors in digital currencies try to keep the risks low, but young people are more risk-taking.According to the researchers, more than half of the surveyed crypto investors use less than a thousand euros when speculating. More than a quarter invested 1,000 to 5,000 euros, while people spending 10,000 euros or more is somewhat rare. Family, friends, acquaintances, colleagues and neighbors play the most important role in choosing which crypto coins to buy or sell, the study showed.Most owners of digital currencies, such as bitcoins and ethereum, are between 25 and 45 years old and the majority are men. A sharp fall in the value of crypto tokens seems to trigger financial problems in young people more often than among investors aged 45 and older.Furthermore, a group of about one in ten crypto speculators said they own digital coins bought with borrowed money. This increases to nearly 20 percent when looking just at younger age groups, according to the study. They are taking a significant risk, as a sharp fall in the value of the crypto investment can make it more difficult to repay the loan.The AFM regularly warns about the risks associated with investments in digital currencies. Cryptocurrencies, unlike bank balances, are also not covered by the deposit guarantee scheme. As a result, there is no financial safety net for consumers who become unable to access their funds kept in different accounts.The prices can also show excessive fluctuations in value. This year, cryptocurrencies have fallen sharply in value and there is a great deal of unrest on the market, partly due to the collapse of the FTX cryptocurrency exchange.According to the AFM, the majority of crypto investors are aware of the regulator's warnings. The European Union is working on regulations for the cryptocurrency market, but that is not expected to come into effect until 2024.

https://nltimes.nl/2022/12/22/people-netherlands-giving-faith-58-religious,More people in the Netherlands giving up on faith: 58% are not religious,22 December 2022 - 08:29,"Residents of the Netherlands are continuing to abandon religion, according to research from Statistics Netherlands (CBS) that looked at the beliefs of people aged 15 and up. Non-religious people first emerged as the majority of the population in 2017, and since then they have continued to make up a larger proportion of society. Fewer than 13 percent of people said they regularly attend religious services.“In 2021, 58 percent of the Dutch population aged 15 or older did not consider themselves to belong to a religious denomination or philosophical group,” the CBS said on Thursday. “A year earlier that was 55 percent, and in 2010 it was still 45 percent.”The sharpest fall was observed among Roman Catholics. Some 27 percent identified as part of that religion in 2010, falling to 19.8 percent in 2020, and 18.3 percent in 2021. Although the proportion of Catholics has dropped significantly, it still represented the largest single religious group in the Netherlands.The percentage of people calling themself Protestant fell from 18.0 percent down to 13.6 percent in 2021. During that time, the popularity of Islam also fell from 5.0 percent to 4.6 percent.On the other hand, the collective group of “other denominations” showed an increase. Over the last decade, this figure fluctuated from a low point of 5.0 percent from 2010-2011, to a high point of 6.5 percent in 2012 and 2015. In 2021, some 6.1 percent of residents said they identified with a different religion or philosophical group than Catholic, Protestant or Islam.The largest proportion of atheists and non-religious people was found in the 18-25 year age range, with 72.4 percent identifying as such. That figure steadily declines as older segments of the population are analyzed, as they fall into the minority with the population 65 and older.People quickly identified as not being religious once they reached the age of 18. About 58.8 percent of those between 15-18 years of age said they were not religious.",CultureLifestyle
https://nltimes.nl/2022/12/22/sharpest-monthly-drop-dutch-housing-prices-since-2013,Sharpest monthly drop in Dutch housing prices since 2013,22 December 2022 - 07:32,"Average home sales prices in the Netherlands fell for the fourth month in the row, with November representing the sharpest recorded decrease since May 2013. Owner occupied homes sold in November cost nearly 1 percent less on average than in October, according to data released on Thursday by Statistics Netherlands (CBS).After years of sharp, dramatic increases in housing prices, a peak was reached in July. The average sales price began to fall because of a combination of factors, mainly the rising mortgage interest rates. That makes it harder for buyers to put together the financing needed to purchase more expensive properties.Overall, the Dutch Central Bank predicted that home prices will fall by about 3 percent in 2023 and 3 percent in 2024. That exceeds predictions from ABN Amro and ING, which both predicted a 2.5 percent fall in 2023.Despite the decrease in November, homes still sold for prices that were 4.9 percent higher than 12 months earlier. That reflected the lowest year-on-year increase in over six years, the CBS said. The year-on-year increase recently peaked at over 21 percent at the start of 2022.After the economic crisis, home sales prices hit a low point in June 2013. Since then, prices have jumped by nearly 95 percent.Additionally, the number of residential real estate transactions have been falling. The Dutch real estate registry, Kadaster, was informed of 15,146 housing transactions in November. That was about 6 percent fewer than a year earlier.“In the first 11 months of 2022, 171,767 homes were sold, down more than 1.6 percent than in the same period of 2021,” the CBS said.",Business
