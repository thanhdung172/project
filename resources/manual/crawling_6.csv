That number will likely increase during the day, said ophthalmologist Tjeerd de Faber. Additionally, four others were treated at Rotterdam Maasstad Hospital for burns on their faces caused by fireworks explosions.Six people have already undergone surgery. De Faber called it an ""old-fashioned horrific night.”Most fireworks victims were hit by decorative fireworks, according to the ophthalmologist. This involved both people who set off the fireworks themselves and bystanders who were watching. ""People think that decorative fireworks are safer, but that is not the case. The wind in particular played a role last night,” which caused the fireworks to either drift in the air, or shoot off in unexpected directions. “One of the patients was hit when he was 25 meters away,"" explained De Faber.One of the victims is permanently blind in one eye, and six others have permanent injuries. It is still unclear how serious the damage is for the rest, reported De Faber. The number of patients may increase, especially because other hospitals refer patients to the Rotterdam facility.Three years ago during the last turn of the new year before coronavirus restrictions hampered celebrations, the hospital treated eighteen patients with eye injuries caused by fireworks. During the coronavirus years, far fewer eye patients required treatment. On January 1, 2022, the Rotterdam Eye Hospital treated five fireworks victims. None of them required surgery at the time.""We are back to square one. It's a shame that this has to be the price of celebrating New Year's again,"" said De Faber. He has been arguing for years for a permanent nationwide ban on fireworks to prevent eye injuries caused by the explosives.Of the four victims treated at the Rotterdam Maasstad Hospital, one was discharged by 4:30 a.m. on New Year’s Day. Two victims were still in the regular care wards at the facility, and one was in intensive care.The fireworks injuries included burns to hands, face and legs. A spokesperson for the hospital could not reveal the victims’ ages. It was also ""very busy"" in the emergency room, but not abnormally so, she said. The emergency department treated a total of six fireworks victims, four of whom were referred to the burn center.The burn center is one of three national burn centers in the country. The other two are in Beverwijk and Groningen. At the beginning of November, the burn centers in the Netherlands reported there had already been a few dozen child victims of fireworks accidents that involved fireworks meant for use by children, such as fountains and ground bloom flowers, the Dutch Burns Foundation reported.Third-degree burns had occurred in some cases, and surgery was a necessity for several children. ""If victims continue to be added at this rate, we can call it a serious problem,"" said pediatric and burns surgeon Annebeth de Vries of the Red Cross Hospital in Beverwijk at the time.",1-1-2
https://nltimes.nl/2022/12/31/niesters-illusion-think-can-stop-coronavirus,Niesters: Illusion to think you can stop coronavirus,31 December 2022 - 17:10,"Whether it is right for the government to offer travelers from China only a voluntary self-test for the coronavirus, virologist Bert Niesters does not know. ""The virus is coming here, we can't stop it, we don't need to have any illusions about that. But Europe now has a mess of rules, and that's a shame. It makes more sense to have a European approach,"" Niesters argued.Other countries require the presentation of a negative Covid-19 test or vaccination certificate before leaving China. This regulation is in place in the United Kingdom, France, Spain and Italy. Also other countries have taken measures, such as the United States, South Korea, Malaysia, Taiwan, Japan and India. Belgium will discuss the situation next week.The Netherlands however, sticks with the self-test offered and the recommendation to go into isolation in case of a positive result. But Niesters does not know what the right approach is. ""I don't have to do politics. I am already glad that the minister is now speaking out, so that something is being said after all. Because the ministry and RIVM were the only ones you didn't hear from last week.""The Dutch are generally well protected against the coronavirus, according to the virologist. People have built up a high level of protection through vaccination and through one or more infections with Covid-19. ""That helps against serious illness, but it doesn't prevent you from getting infected. And even if it's the omicron variety, you can get reasonably sick from it. We're not worried that there will be a dangerous variant, but who can predict the future?""For Niesters, the big problem is in the numbers. ""The wave in China is huge. Assuming half of the Chinese are infected, we're talking about 700 million people. That's more cases than have been detected worldwide so far. That's not a small peak.""The virologist explained that he is sometimes shocked at the number of people infected on flights from China. In Milan recently, about half of all passengers on some flights from China tested positive. ""If half are (tested) positive, everyone is infected, you can assume that. Because then you can't escape it if you're on a plane with others for 12 hours. But the chance that you won't get infected then is very small.""
That is why, according to Niesters, it is important for China to continue testing for the coronavirus and analyzing test samples to determine which variants are circulating. These so-called sequences should then also be shared by the country with the rest of the world. ""Groningen has also shared more results in recent months. The World Health Organization has asked China to provide more up-to-date information so we can make risk assessments and take effective action.""",Health

The moment you attack an emergency worker who is there for your safety, freedom and health, you should be punished really severely,"" Yeşilgöz told Dutch newspaper Omroep Flevoland. ""Don't harass social workers. Otherwise, you have to face consequences for the rest of your life, because you can also be punished very strictly,"" the minister emphasized. This is the first time in two years that fireworks have been allowed to be set off again. They were banned in the last two New Year's Eve years because of the pandemic. This resulted in fewer arrests and incidents compared to previous years. The ban was intended to relieve the already strained medical care system.However, it is illegal to set off firecrackers and flares. In 12 municipalities, residents are also not allowed to set off fireworks.",Politics

The German Joseph Aloisius Ratzinger, as he was known by his real name, turned 95.""With the passing of Pope Emeritus Benedict XVI, the Roman Catholic Church and all Catholics worldwide lose an important spiritual and intellectual leader. We remember him with respect,"" the Prime Minister tweeted.Met het overlijden van Paus emeritus Benedictus XVI verliezen de Rooms-Katholieke Kerk en alle katholieken wereldwijd een belangrijk spiritueel en intellectueel leider. We herdenken hem met respect.According to Minister and CDA chairman Wopke Hoekstra (Foreign Affairs), Benedict XVI was committed to promoting peace and strengthening understanding between people of different races, nations and religious backgrounds.Saddened by the passing of former Pope Benedict XVI. He worked hard to promote peace and foster understanding between people of different races, nations and religious backgrounds. My sincere condolences to Catholics around the world and to all who hold him in their hearts.The Dutch bishops are asking to pray for the peace of mind of dead Pope Emeritus Benedict XVI. The call was made by Bishop Hans van den Hende of the Diocese of Rotterdam, chairman of the Dutch Bishops' Conference.According to Van den Hende, love for the Pope Emeritus was the common thread in the social teaching of the Catholic Church. In 2009, he also wrote an encyclical about it titled Caritas in Veritate (Love in Truth). ""For Benedict, faith found its completion in the love of Christ. For him, faith and love belonged together. We can transmit this love from our encounter with Christ,"" Bishop Van den Hende said.In response to the death of the former head of the Catholic Church, Cardinal Wim Eijk said that “Benedict XIV was a true man of God and a pope after Jesus' heart. He was extremely lovable and undeservedly misunderstood by many.” Eijk met Pope Benedict personally and quite frequently when Joseph Ratzinger himself was still a cardinal and prefect of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith. Nevertheless, the years in which Pope Emeritus Benedict XVI led the Roman Catholic Church have been overshadowed by scandals over the sexual abuse of minors by clergy. Before he was elected pope in April 2005, numerous scandals had already emerged in the United States, followed by other countries such as Belgium, the Netherlands and his native country Germany.He was accused of not doing enough about the abuse, even though he spoke to victims in the United States, among other countries, and condemned the abuse on several occasions. Furthermore, Benedict XVI also allegedly covered up clerical misconduct as prefect of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith (1981-2005) and before that as archbishop of Munich.",Culture

As a result, the price of fossil fuel has come closer to the price at the beginning of this year. The warm weather this winter means that European gas reserves are still full. As a result, European countries and energy companies are willing to pay less to buy more gas.The price of a megawatt hour of gas on Amsterdam's leading exchange was still above 80 euros at the start of the trading day but fell by around 10 percent by the end of the day. This means that the difference compared with the price at the beginning of the year is around 13 percent. This is despite the fact that the price of gas reached a peak of more than 200 euros per megawatt hour shortly after the Russian invasion of Ukraine.When Russia largely turned off the gas tap this summer, the price of gas rose even further to almost 350 euros per megawatt hour. From then on, European countries bought gas en masse from other countries to meet their obligations, but also to fill their gas storage facilities.In addition to the favorable temperatures, another factor was that more electricity was generated by wind turbines. As a result, less gas was needed to generate electricity.In general, the price of gas is still significantly higher than last summer. In mid-2021, the price was still around 20 euros per megawatt hour.",PoliticsBusiness

While the fireworks industry expects to sell 10 percent more legal fireworks than in 2019, police and unions are particularly concerned about heavy illegal firecrackers. Twelve municipalities are also preparing to impose a total ban at the turn of the year.In Amsterdam, Rotterdam, Schiedam, Nijmegen and Apeldoorn for instance, fireworks are not allowed to set off at all. The capital sees enforcement as a ""major challenge"" due to limited police capacity. In Rotterdam however, special enforcement officers monitor compliance with the ban on setting off fireworks. In Heumen, on the border between Gelderland and Limburg, and in neighboring Mook and Middelaar, where a ban also applies, a security service carries out checks at the turn of the year.In addition to enforcing the regulations, the municipalities also want to encourage people in other ways not to set off fireworks. For example, New Year's celebrations have been organized in several cities, but the predicted bad weather with strong winds threatens to put a stop to the festivities.In Apeldoorn, one of the three planned shows, the drone light show at Zuiderpark, was canceled as well as firework shows in the Hague and Zoetermeer.

There is a cheaper alternative within every big insurance company. So, if you currently have the basic insurance package from Zilveren Kruis, CZ, VGZ or Menzis, there are loads of opportunities to save some money in 2023.

Popular examples include:But how do you know which plans have the best extras for your situation?Zorgwijzer’s English comparison tool gives you a solid overview of all the plusses and minuses per health insurance plan. Check it out for yourselfIn some cases, it is much cheaper to simply go with a basic insurance plan and ignore the supplemental insurance plans. Just pay for certain treatments yourself. This could be the case for reimbursements like: You can check for yourself if certain supplemental insurances are worthwhile or not. Just follow these steps when choosing a supplemental plan:Health insurance companies have a duty of acceptance for their basic health insurance plans. This means the insurer is not allowed to refuse your insurance request, based on your age, background, healthcare situation or gender. So if even if you need a great deal of healthcare or expensive medication, you will always be accepted, even if it is the cheapest or most extensive basic plan. For the most part, the same situation applies for supplemental insurance plans. Some exceptions apply:For these coverages, a waiting time of one year or medical selection might be demanded, which may lead to non-acceptance. Many people do not know that it is possible to choose a new insurance plan next January. So, in fact you have a whole month extra to compare a health insurance (in Dutch, this is called: zorgverzekering vergelijken). The only important thing to make use of this is to make sure that your current insurance plan is cancelled before the end of the year. Are you going to change your health insurance for 2023? Then you always have a 14-day reflection period in which you can cancel your decision for free and at no cost. Just be aware that this only applies for people that use the internet or phone to close their insurance plan.Still don’t know what to choose?

""Rest in Peace, Pelé.""A football icon.Rest in peace, Pelé. 🤍 pic.twitter.com/hFbQ3rjtaJ""Gratitude for your legacy,"" Seedorf wrote. He himself ended his own football career in Brazil at the beginning of 2014 with Rio de Janeiro's Botafogo club. Pelé played almost his entire career for Santos in São Paulo.Pelé influence ""can’t be measured simply by his 3 World Cup victories. ""The love of the people on the world for the game, the globalisation of the game and your social impact globally, the racial awareness that opened the doors for black players and of course your magic with the ball and so much more,"" Seedorf continued. ""It has been a long and amazing journey. You have taught us so many lessons.""Pelé not only gave Brazil its first world title in 1958, followed by two more World Cups in 1962 and 1970, but also became a figurehead for the Black population with a similar background in the South American country. Nicknamed ""O Rei,"" which translates as The King, he was criticized for rarely using his status to draw attention to racism or political issues.After his career as a football ambassador, Pelé devoted himself to social projects by the United Nations and Unicef, among others. Last summer, he called on Russian President Vladimir Putin in an open letter to end the war in Ukraine.Sad day for the world of football. Rest in peace, Pelé 🤍 pic.twitter.com/uVe6frAHO1""Until your last moment it was all positivity and love towards the people you connected with and the whole world,"" said 46-year-old Seedorf, who won the Champions League a total of four times with Ajax, Real Madrid and AC Milan. ""You shall always be remembered as the king of football and most importantly you will be remembered for the great human being you have been during your time on this earth.""Aside from the KNVB's message, other Dutch football organizations made their feelings known.Ajax published a photo on Twitter of Pelé in an embrace with Johan Cruijff, who died in 2016. ""A sad day for football. Rest in peace, Pelé,"" said the Amsterdam club.PSV shared a message from Pelé's account announcing his death with two emoji, the Brazilian flag, and two hands folded together in prayer. PSV then also posted a photo from 1963, when Pelé played football against PSV in Eindhoven. That was a day after the friendly match between the Netherlands and Brazil in Amsterdam.A post shared by Clarence Seedorf (@clarenceseedorf)",Sports
